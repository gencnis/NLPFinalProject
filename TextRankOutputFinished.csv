 farming skill
the farming skill level can be viewed in the skill tab of the pause menu.","the basic formula for finding a silver quality crop is 2% + 4% per level, though the game must first fail to award a gold quality crop before it will check to award a silver quality crop, so the chances for a silver quality are slightly reduced. note the probability calculation must take that into account: for instance on a soil without deluxe fertilizer, silver quality can be selected only if gold has not been chosen, and then the global chance for silver is equal to (1 - chance for gold quality) * (minimum between (0.75) and (2 * chance for gold quality)). crops that yield multiple produce per harvest, such as blueberry, cranberry, or potato, only reward experience for the first product and do not offer any extra experience for the multiples.

tiller profession details
internally, the game tracks whether fruit came from a foraging or non-foraging source, and uses this internal information to determine whether or not the fruit should get the +10% tiller profession bonus when sold.","[1]
sources that are considered to be foraging are:

wild-grown fruit that randomly spawns throughout stardew valley, as detailed at foraged items and spawning
fruit grown from any of the four varieties of wild seeds
all fruit found in the farm cave -- including fruit tree fruit that otherwise is not considered to be foraged
all other sources are considered to be non-foraging, including (but not limited to):

fruit grown from standard seeds (e.g., grapes from grape starter)
fruit collected from trees
fruit sent in the mail as a gift
fruit purchased from the oasis
blackberries and salmonberries harvested from bushes
if the player has both foraged and non-foraged fruit of the same quality, stacking the items together always results in non-foraged fruit: the tiller bonus will apply to the entire stack of fruit. below is a list of fruits from the game, where to obtain them and how much they sell for when processed into jelly using the preserves jar, or into wine using the keg. ↑ the code in object:addtostack was changed in v1.4 to ensure isspawnedobject is set to false whenever two mixed stacks are combined, i.e., that the tiller bonus applies if either stack originally had it. ",0.032802249
Corpus\Fruits.txt,"below is a list of fruits from the game, where to obtain them and how much they sell for when processed into jelly using the preserves jar, or into wine using the keg.whether or not fruit benefits from the +10% tiller profession price bonus depends upon whether or not the specific fruit was obtained by foraging, although the details can become complex.image

tiller profession details
internally, the game tracks whether fruit came from a foraging or non-foraging source, and uses this internal information to determine whether or not the fruit should get the +10% tiller profession bonus when sold.","[1]
sources that are considered to be foraging are:

wild-grown fruit that randomly spawns throughout stardew valley, as detailed at foraged items and spawning
fruit grown from any of the four varieties of wild seeds
all fruit found in the farm cave -- including fruit tree fruit that otherwise is not considered to be foraged
all other sources are considered to be non-foraging, including (but not limited to):

fruit grown from standard seeds (e.g., grapes from grape starter)
fruit collected from trees
fruit sent in the mail as a gift
fruit purchased from the oasis
blackberries and salmonberries harvested from bushes
if the player has both foraged and non-foraged fruit of the same quality, stacking the items together always results in non-foraged fruit: the tiller bonus will apply to the entire stack of fruit. below is a list of fruits from the game, where to obtain them and how much they sell for when processed into jelly using the preserves jar, or into wine using the keg. ↑ the code in object:addtostack was changed in v1.4 to ensure isspawnedobject is set to false whenever two mixed stacks are combined, i.e., that the tiller bonus applies if either stack originally had it.

 truffle


the pig is an animal that lives in a deluxe barn.","prerequisites for truffle generation
a pig will only produce a truffle if all of the following are true:

the pig has been fed
the pig has been let outside the barn
it is not raining/storming
it is not winter
there are available tiles outside with which to place a truffle
chance to produce the first truffle
a pig has a 0.02% chance on each frame to generate a truffle if:

it has not yet generated a truffle for the day
it is standing on a free tile
this means that there is around a 99.99% chance that a pig will generate a truffle each day, with the assumption that it is walking around on mostly free tiles. the more animals there are inside the same barn, the higher the chance an animal will give birth. this means that each day, the location of any generated truffles will be random, based on where the pig has walked.

 for a detailed analysis of profit using the preserves jar, see preserves jar productivity.the preserves jar is a type of artisan equipment used to make artisan goods.","preserves jar vs. keg
see also: preserves jar productivity, keg productivity
the preserves jar increases the profit of a crop using the following equation: (2 × base crop value + 50); while the keg multiplies the base value of fruits by 3, and vegetables by 2.25. because of this, low-value, high-yield crops like corn or tomatoes are more valuable in the preserves jar. below is a list of crops that are more beneficial to be put in the preserves jar, along with their raw base sell price. it should be noted that these calculations only involve the value gained in terms of max profit; if looking at profit per day based on the time required, the preserves jar outpaces the keg regardless of the base value of the item (in every case except for hops and wheat) since the preserves jar has a much faster processing time.

it is possible to get three harvests from strawberry plants during spring of year 1. this requires using speed-gro and planting on spring 13, and the easiest way to do this is to complete the spring crops bundle; this requires planting cauliflower on spring 1 as well as visiting the community center after the egg festival before planting the strawberries. the other way to acquire speed-gro by spring 13 is to craft it, but this requires achieving level 3 foraging by spring 6 to acquire pine tar in time, which is more difficult. history
