sources that are considered to be foraging are:

wild-grown fruit that randomly spawns throughout stardew valley, as detailed at foraged items and spawning
fruit grown from any of the four varieties of wild seeds
all fruit found in the farm cave -- including fruit tree fruit that otherwise is not considered to be foraged
all other sources are considered to be non-foraging, including (but not limited to):

fruit grown from standard seeds (e.g., grapes from grape starter)
fruit collected from trees
fruit sent in the mail as a gift
fruit purchased from the oasis
blackberries and salmonberries harvested from bushes

tiller profession details
internally, the game tracks whether fruit came from a foraging or non-foraging source, and uses this internal information to determine whether or not the fruit should get the +10% tiller profession bonus when sold.","[1]
sources that are considered to be foraging are:

wild-grown fruit that randomly spawns throughout stardew valley, as detailed at foraged items and spawning
fruit grown from any of the four varieties of wild seeds
all fruit found in the farm cave -- including fruit tree fruit that otherwise is not considered to be foraged
all other sources are considered to be non-foraging, including (but not limited to):

fruit grown from standard seeds (e.g., grapes from grape starter)
fruit collected from trees
fruit sent in the mail as a gift
fruit purchased from the oasis
blackberries and salmonberries harvested from bushes
if the player has both foraged and non-foraged fruit of the same quality, stacking the items together always results in non-foraged fruit: the tiller bonus will apply to the entire stack of fruit. below is a list of fruits from the game, where to obtain them and how much they sell for when processed into jelly using the preserves jar, or into wine using the keg. ↑ the code in object:addtostack was changed in v1.4 to ensure isspawnedobject is set to false whenever two mixed stacks are combined, i.e., that the tiller bonus applies if either stack originally had it.

the octopus is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at the beach or on the beach farm during summer or in the ocean on ginger island west during any season.it can also randomly be found in garbage cans during summer, or at the traveling cart for 450-1,000g.","1.4.4: fixed a mistake in the game data that prevented octopus-specific fish pond data from being applied (in earlier versions, octopus used the same fish pond data as all generic ocean fish). the most efficient way to try to catch this is to reach fishing level 10, equip the iridium rod, eat a food that provides a fishing buff, and attach a trap bobber or cork bobber to the fishing pole. to make it more demanding, the chances of hooking an octopus and the window of time to catch it are very small.

see also: preserves jar productivity, keg productivity
the preserves jar increases the profit of a crop using the following equation: (2 × base crop value + 50); while the keg multiplies the base value of fruits by 3, and vegetables by 2.25. because of this, low-value, high-yield crops like corn or tomatoes are more valuable in the preserves jar. below is a list of crops that are more beneficial to be put in the preserves jar, along with their raw base sell price. it should be noted that these calculations only involve the value gained in terms of max profit; if looking at profit per day based on the time required, the preserves jar outpaces the keg regardless of the base value of the item (in every case except for hops and wheat) since the preserves jar has a much faster processing time.
