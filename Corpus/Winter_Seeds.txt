Winter Seeds are a type of Crafted seed. The crafting recipe is labeled "Wild Seeds (Wi)", but when crafted, the result is "Winter Seeds."  Mature plants yield, at random, a Crocus, Crystal Fruit, Snow Yam, or Winter Root.  
Winter Seeds are one of the season-specific crafted wild seeds, along with Spring Seeds, Summer Seeds, and Fall Seeds that produce crops normally found as forage.  While Farming Skill normally increases the chance to grow a quality crop, Foraging Skill increases the chance to grow a quality crop from Winter Seeds. Choosing the Botanist profession will ensure iridium-quality crops grown from Winter Seeds.   
Crows do not attack crops grown from Winter Seeds, so the use of Scarecrows is unnecessary.

Tea Sapling

Takes 20 days to mature. Produces tea leaves during the final week of each season, except winter. No watering necessary!

Wild Seeds (any) (2) Fiber (5) Wood (5)

Mail the day after Caroline's 2-heart event

500g


Profitability
Selling Winter Seeds is never profitable. A craft of Winter seeds yields 10 Winter Seeds worth 300g total, but the ingredients to craft it sell for 380g at normal quality.

Gallery
Wild Seeds from any season may appear similar to dead crops during Stage 2 of growth.


Bugs
On Ginger Island, mature Winter Seeds may destroy the tilled soil (and fertilizer), leaving untilled soil in their place after harvest.

History
1.4: Can be used in the Tea Sapling recipe.
1.5: Bugfix for stages of growth with Agriculturist + Deluxe Fertilizer.
1.5.6: Dirt under freshly grown seasonal forage seeds no longer disappears randomly, except on Ginger Island.
