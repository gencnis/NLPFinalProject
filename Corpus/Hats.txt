Obtaining hats
The day after earning their first Achievement, players will receive a letter from the mouse in the Abandoned House alerting them that hats can now be purchased there. Most Achievements unlock a new hat, which can be purchased for 1,000g.
A few hats can only be obtained at certain festivals, the casino, the Adventurer's Guild, or in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern.
Hats can also be tailored at the sewing machine in Emily's house.
