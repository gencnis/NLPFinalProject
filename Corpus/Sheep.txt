Produce
Main article: Animals#Produce
Sheep who eat every day mature after 4 nights have passed. Once mature, a Sheep periodically grows a wool coat, which can be shorn with Shears that can be purchased at Marnie's Ranch. Alternatively, an Auto-Grabber will automatically shear every Sheep in a Barn.
A mature sheep grows in its coat every 3 days, if it is fed and has at least 70 happiness. Having at least 4.5 Hearts (900 points) of Friendship reduces the time by one day. The Shepherd Profession also reduces the time by one day. Both together reduce the time by two days, resulting in a sheep capable of producing wool every day.
Wool can be placed in a Loom to produce Cloth, which sells for 470g. Quality Wool has a chance to produce 2 Cloth.
