Magic Bait is a type of bait that provides the ability to catch any fish from that source regardless of weather, time, or season. It can be attached to a Fiberglass Rod or an Iridium Rod. It can also technically be inserted into a Crab Pot, but it is no better than standard bait as all crab pot fish can be caught anytime in any season in any weather. Bait is always a single-use item. Magic Bait has the same effect on fish bite rate as standard Bait (decreasing biting time by 50%).
20 Magic Bait can be purchased from the shop in Qi's Walnut Room for  5. The recipe to craft Magic Bait can also be purchased for  20.
