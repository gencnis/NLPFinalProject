“

“Long ago, my people knew the secrets of advanced technology. The archaeological evidence proves that. But I wonder where it came from? And where did it all go? I guess some questions will never be answered...”


— Dwarf


The Dwarf is a valley resident who lives in The Mines.  Initially the way is blocked off by an unbreakable rock, just inside the entrance. After upgrading to at least a steel pickaxe, the stone can be broken. A cherry bomb (or stronger bomb) will also break the rock.
The Dwarf will start out speaking Dwarvish, which is unreadable by the player. To understand Dwarvish the 4 Dwarvish scrolls must be acquired from within the mines. After donating them to the museum, Gunther will reward the player with the Dwarvish Translation Guide to use which allows for understanding the Dwarf's speech. Purchases from the Dwarf's shop cannot be made and friendship cannot be affected with the Dwarf until Dwarvish is understood.
The Dwarf's gender in the game data is "undefined" (see Content\Data\NPCDispositions.xnb).

Schedule
The Dwarf lives just to the east of the entrance to the mines and does not move from there.

Relationships
Due to a 1000-year war between the Dwarves and the shadow people, Dwarf is sometimes suspicious of the player, believing they may be a spy sent by the shadow people.
The Dwarf appears to have some respect for the wizard, as seen in their heart event.
The Dwarf harbors dislike for Krobus, on account of the aforementioned war between their people, the outcome of which caused the dwarf race to disappear, leaving behind only relics (found as artifacts)

Heart Events
50 Friendship Points

After earning 50 Friendship points with the Dwarf, enter The Sewers. A Stardrop must have been purchased from Krobus.



Details 


Dwarf finds Krobus in the Sewers and blames the Shadow People for the death of their family. Krobus retorts by saying that he only resorted to violence after the dwarves drove them from their ancestral homeland. Krobus gives an apology for what happened to Dwarf's family but Dwarf doesn't accept it. They both start fighting. The player descends into the Sewers and gets between them. Dwarf yells, "Let me at him! He's despicable." Krobus retorts, "Come and get it, shrimpy." Suddenly, the Wizard appears and stops the fight. He reminds them that "The Elemental Wars have long been finished" and tells them to make peace for the sake of the humans that live around them. Dwarf consents to this and promises to stay away from the sewers. Krobus once again apologizes for the past and states that he has no personal gripe with Dwarf. The Wizard casts a 'Seal of Promise' to finalize the agreement.

Quotes
First Meeting




“

“Hey, you're pretty good at mining, for a human.”


Regular




“

“I got all this stuff from the surface. I just take it from your people during the night. Hmm? What is this concept you call "private property"?”





“

“Ah... cave carrot stew, cave carrot roast, cave carrot soup and cave carrots au gratin.
...And a ramekin of cave carrot brulee to sweeten the night.
What?”






“

“Hey, wanna buy something?”





“

“I feel most comfortable underground. The deeper underground the better.”





“

“You've never seen a dwarf before, have you?”





“

“It's dangerous in the mines. Why don't you buy a few things from my shop to ensure your safety?”





“

“One day you'll have to tell me about this beverage you call "milk"”





“

“You're not a spy sent by the Shadow People, are you? I'm keeping my eye on you.”





“

“Most humans fear the unknown... that's why I've hidden my shop here. Your mining skills prove you're trustworthy.”


Rainy Days




“

“Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us dwarves live our entire lives without ever experiencing it.”


6+ Hearts




“

“Long ago, my people knew the secrets of advanced technology. The archaeological evidence proves that.
But I wonder where it came from? And where did it all go? I guess some questions will never be answered...”

Trivia
The large rock leading to the Dwarf can be destroyed with a cherry bomb (or stronger bomb), but that's not mentioned in the message shown when trying to break it with a low-level Pickaxe.
The Dwarf may have took inspiration from the Jawas from Star Wars.
Despite having dialogue suggesting an interest in milk, the Dwarf dislikes all milks.
The Dwarf loves all the movies in the Movie Theater, so it's a good way to improve relationship.
