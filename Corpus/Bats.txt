Attacks
Bats are a flying enemy that will come at the character from any direction. It will fly towards them, sometimes directly and sometimes at an angle to surround and attack from a different position! 
Bats have 3 methods of appearing:

They can be regular enemies on the floor - their wings are folded and they are hanging from the ceiling. Approaching them makes them active, and they will attack the player from this point on.
They can appear at random. The character will hear a bat screech and one will approach from a random direction from outside the level.
On some levels a colored fog will appear over the area. Multiple bats will start attacking from various directions.
Strategy
Since bats may appear from different directions, simultaneously to one another and other monsters, they can get dangerous especially early game. The best weapon against bats is a regular sword swing (not a club or dagger), since its angle is large. Finding the right timing is easy for a single bat, but might be tricker for multiple fliers. One strategy is to move in a contrary direction to the bats so they are all on one side, and swing at them all at once.

Trivia
Starting at and below floor 880 in the Skull Cavern on non-Prehistoric floors, Iridium Bats will be colored red and have double health and greatly increased speed.[5]
