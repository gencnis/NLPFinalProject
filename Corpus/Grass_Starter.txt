Tips
To prevent animals from eating your grass starter you can place a fence post or lightning rod on top of it after it is planted. This will let the grass continue to grow without losing the starter.
Grass Starter is meant to be used outside where farm animals can eat it, but it can be placed inside a Farm Building, or anywhere outside The Farm.  Animals will not eat it, and it will not grow/spread, but it can be harvested to create Hay.
Bugs
Grass starter can be planted on The Farm anytime in Winter, and it will grow and spread, just like during any other season.
Any grass patches on the Farm on Winter 28 will multiply up to 40x each on Spring 1, unless you exit the game.
