Cost:

25g




Sold by:

Fish Shop



The Training Rod is a special tool used to catch fish. It can be purchased for 25g from Willy's Fish Shop. This rod is useful if the player has difficulty with the fishing minigame, as it sets the player's fishing skill equal to level 5 for the purposes of determining how big to make the green bar (136 pixels), but only if they have not reached level 5 yet. It cannot have bait or tackle attached to it.
The Training Rod can catch only basic fish (fish whose difficulty is lower than 50), and all fish caught will be of normal quality. However, fish caught with the Training Rod grant the same XP as with any other fishing rod, and count towards Achievements and the Fish Collection. Treasure chests can also be caught with this rod.

Fish
The Training Rod can catch the following fish:
Anchovy, Bream, Bullhead, Carp, Chub,  Herring, Perch, Rainbow Trout, Red Snapper, Sardine, Sea Cucumber, Shad, Smallmouth Bass, Sunfish, Walleye, All Legendary Fish (see below)
Like with other rods, the Training Rod can also catch Trash, Green Algae, White Algae, and Seaweed.

Bugs
Because the Legendary Fish are not subject to the training rod difficulty check like other fish, it is possible to catch Legendary Fish with the Training Rod.
