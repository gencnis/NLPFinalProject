Recipe Source:

 "Robin's Resource Rush" Special Order


Ingredients:

 Stone (50)


The Stone Chest is a craftable storage item that holds up to 36 different types of items, much like the wooden Chest. The recipe is obtained by mail after completing the Special Order "Robin's Resource Rush".
A maximum of 999 identical items can be stacked into a single slot in a Stone Chest. Items do not decompose in Stone Chests.
Stone Chests can be left in many different places in Stardew Valley. However, if a Stone Chest is left on a walking pathway for a villager it will disappear, and its contents dropped. See "Crafted goods outside the farm" for maps of areas safe from villager pathing.
An empty stone chest can be picked up and returned to inventory by hitting it with any tool, or hitting repeatedly with an empty hand. Stone chests with any items inside cannot be picked up until emptied; however if a filled chest is hit repeatedly with just an empty hand, it will be pushed one tile away from the player (note that tools will not work for pushing). If that tile is not valid for item placement, the chest can jump to the nearest acceptable tile, such as behind the player, to a diagonally adjacent tile, or over other items to a valid one.

Coloring
When opened, Stone Chests have a color bar above their inventory window which allows players to select a different color for the Stone Chest. This can be changed at anytime without cost. There are 20 colors available to select in the color picker. The default color is equivalent to the "white" color in the color bar.
