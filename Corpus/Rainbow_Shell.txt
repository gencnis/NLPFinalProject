The Rainbow Shell is found via foraging at The Beach in the Summer. It may also spawn on the Beach Farm during any season. It can also be obtained through the Traveling Cart or in The Mines after activating the Shrine of Challenge or during the Danger In The Deep quest. It may also be sent in the mail as a gift from Demetrius or received as a gift from Jas or Vincent at the Feast of the Winter Star. A Rainbow Trout Fish Pond has a 2% chance to produce 1 Rainbow Shell daily when the population of the pond reaches 9.
