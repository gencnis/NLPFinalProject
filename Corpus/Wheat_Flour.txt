Ingredients:

 Wheat (1)


Wheat Flour is a cooking ingredient that can be consumed by itself. It can be purchased year round from Pierre's General Store for 100g or from JojaMart for 125g. 4-7 Wheat Flour may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least once.
Players have the ability to craft wheat flour from wheat by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one wheat will make one wheat flour. Wheat placed inside will appear as Wheat Flour in the box beside the Mill the next morning. 
Note: Wheat flour made using the mill is profitable; it can then be cooked into Bread, which is also profitable. However, it is even more profitable to put Wheat into a Keg to make Beer.
