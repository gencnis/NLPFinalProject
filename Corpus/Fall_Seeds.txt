Fall Seeds are a type of Crafted seed. The crafting recipe is labeled "Wild Seeds (Fa)", but when crafted, the result is "Fall Seeds."  Mature plants yield, at random, a Blackberry, Common Mushroom, Hazelnut, or Wild Plum.  
Fall Seeds are one of the season-specific crafted wild seeds, along with Spring Seeds, Summer Seeds, and Winter Seeds that produce crops normally found as forage.  While Farming Skill normally increases the chance to grow a quality crop, Foraging Skill increases the chance to grow a quality crop from Fall Seeds. Choosing the Botanist profession will ensure iridium-quality crops grown from Fall Seeds.   
Crows do not attack crops grown from Fall Seeds, so the use of Scarecrows is unnecessary.

Profitability
Fall Seeds are a profitable recipe without the Botanist Profession. A craft of Fall seeds yields 10 seeds worth 450g total, while a set of regular-quality ingredients to craft it sells for only 230g and a set of gold-quality ingredients sells for 345g.  With the Botanist Profession, selling the individual crops yields 460g.

Gallery
Wild Seeds from any season may appear similar to dead crops during Stage 2 of growth.


Bugs
On Ginger Island, mature Fall Seeds may destroy the tilled soil (and fertilizer), leaving untilled soil in their place after harvest.

History
1.4: Can be used in the Tea Sapling recipe.
1.5: Bugfix for stages of growth with Agriculturist + Deluxe Fertilizer.
1.5.6: Dirt under freshly grown seasonal forage seeds no longer disappears randomly, except on Ginger Island.
