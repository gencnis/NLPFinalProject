“

“Harvey is the town doctor. He’s a little old for a bachelor, but he has a kind heart and a respected position in the community. He lives in a small apartment above the medical clinic, but spends most of his time working. You can sense a sadness about him, as if there’s something he’s not telling you…”


— Dev Update #12


Harvey is a villager who lives in Pelican Town. He runs the town's medical clinic and is passionate about the health of the townsfolk. He's one of the twelve characters available to marry.

Schedule
On Tuesdays and Thursdays Harvey gives villagers their annual or quarterly checkups. On most other days he spends the morning manning the counter at the clinic, and the afternoon taking exercise around town. 
On rainy days, Harvey leaves the clinic and walks upstairs to his room at 12pm, regardless of whether or not there are patients in the clinic. Later, he stops by the Stardrop Saloon.
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Harvey may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Harvey will immediately go home to bed. Harvey never visits the Resort on Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Festival days.
Shown below are Harvey's schedules prioritized highest to lowest within each season. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

Heart Events
Two Hearts

Enter George's house while George is there.



Details 


Harvey is performing a private check-up on George. He tries to explain that George needs to make some lifestyle changes if he wants to keep healthy, but George seems irritated with his advice and states that he knows what's best for his own body. Harvey explains that he went to school for eight years so that he could help people in an attempt to get George to cooperate, but then his attention is drawn away as he notices your arrival. Harvey says you shouldn't be there because it is a private session, but George stops you from leaving by asking for a second opinion on the matter.
"George should follow Dr. Harvey's advice." (+40 friendship.) He again says that he's only trying to help and George finally gives in and agrees to follow doctor's orders. After that Harvey thanks you for the help and say that he appreciates you.
"George knows what's best for his own body." (-40 friendship.) He sighs and tells George that if he's going to behave like this, Harvey will have to tell George's wife and she won't be happy. George begrudgingly concedes to the doctor's orders. Harvey tells you that it's better not to give patients mixed messages.

Four Hearts

Enter the clinic when Harvey is there.



Details 


Harvey says he was just about to write you a letter about how you're due for your annual check-up. As he's looking you over, he notices your pulse seems high.
"I'm a little nervous..." (+20 friendship.) Harvey assumes that it's because of the Hospital and tells you to relax because he's here to help.
"I'm out of breath from working on the farm." (+20 friendship.)
"Are you really a doctor? My pulse is fine!" (-50 friendship.)
At the end of it, Harvey declares you healthy and says you should take care not to overwork yourself on the farm.


Six Hearts

Enter the general store between 11am and 3pm.



Details 


 You witness a dance aerobics session with some of the ladies and, unexpectedly, Harvey. Harvey seems out of breath as the session comes to an end, heading towards the door to leave but running into you on the way. Harvey seems incredibly embarrassed when he finds out you were watching, wanting to keep it a secret. He explains that he's doing it to stay healthy, which becomes more difficult with age and the stress of running the clinic essentially alone. Harvey seems discouraged because of how difficult it is for him to keep up with the rest of the group, figuring he must not be in good shape. He asks you not to tell the rest of the town that he's doing dance aerobics.
"I won't tell" (+20 friendship.) Harvey thanks you and says that he appreciates you.
"I can't promise that." (-50 friendship.) Harvey sighs and says "rude".

Eight Hearts

Enter the clinic.



Details 


You head into Harvey's room to find him using his equipment in an attempt to contact a pilot. He suddenly gets a response, surprising him and making his pulse race, but he manages to respond with his coordinates before quickly signing off.  As you enter the room, you are presented with two choices:
"Ask Harvey why he's all flustered." (No effect on friendship.)
"Pretend like everything's normal." (No effect on friendship.)
Either way, Harvey's response is the same.  He notices you and tells you he made contact with a real pilot. He excitedly tells you to come over to the window to watch the pilot fly overhead with him. After the plane passes Harvey opens up about how he always wanted to be a pilot when he was younger, but couldn't because of his bad eyesight and crippling fear of heights. He tells you not to be sad about it, that he's accepted not everyone can achieve their dreams and that is just the way the world is. Harvey tries to lighten the mood by asking you to look at his model planes, having just finished the TR-Starbird deluxe set.



Ten Hearts

Harvey sends you a letter asking to meet at the railroad tracks. Go there between 9am and 5pm.



Details 


When you meet him there, he says he's glad you came and that something should be happening very soon. A man in a hot air balloon, Marcello, lands nearby, says the balloon is yours for the next two hours, and heads into town for the Stardrop Saloon. Harvey tells you that he saw the hot air balloon rental advertised in the newspaper and thought it was a perfect thing to do together. Before hopping in, you can either immediately get to it or ask him why he did this since you know about his incredible fear of heights. If you opt to ask him, he bashfully explains that while his fear is still a major factor, he admires you and your courage and says that it should be more than enough for the both of you.
Boarding the hot air balloon, Harvey switches on the burner below to make it ascend but freaks out once he realizes how fast it's rising. High in the sky, his mood oscillates between fear and elation, eventually coming to his senses and remembering that you're there with him. He marvels at how much he can see below and is glad that he's doing this with you. Soon before the two-hour rental is up, you draw close into a kiss. You return the balloon to the rental man at least a half hour late.



Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelors, raised friendship with each bachelor to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelor's 10-heart event, then entering The Stardrop Saloon will trigger a cutscene. If Alex is the final bachelor you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a friendly game of pool.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelors will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelors will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelors will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Enter an upgraded farm house (needs to be upgraded at least twice) between 8pm and midnight.



Details 


In the cutscene, Harvey is seen cooking and then setting the table for dinner. As you enter, Harvey says you're just in time and tells you he's cooked angel hair pasta with clams. He asks you how the dish tastes and he asks what you did that day.
At the end, Harvey offers to wash the dishes and says he is happy to do so.


Marriage
Main article: Marriage
Once married, Harvey will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a small garden behind the farmhouse where he'll sometimes go to read.  He will continue to work at the clinic and travel to town to work there on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
On mornings when Harvey stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you Complete Breakfast.  On rainy nights he may offer you dinner:  Salmon Dinner, Crispy Bass, Fried Eel, Carp Surprise, or Vegetable Medley.

Regular




“

“We sell a few over-the-counter medicines at the clinic... feel free to stop by if you're feeling exhausted. I know that being a farmer is pretty tiring work... don't overdo it!”





“

“I feel responsible for the health of this whole community... it's kind of stressful. It's a pretty small community, and I'm fortunate to be able to build a good relationship with my patients.”





“

“Feel free to stop by my office if you're ever feeling ill. You're young, though. You'll probably stay healthy without trying.”





“

“I'd like to get to know you better, [Player]. Let's put aside our doctor-patient relationship.”





“

“Remember to cover your mouth when you sneeze. Then make sure to wash your hands.”





“

“Nutrition is important, so make sure and eat well. Try to increase your vegetable intake! Home-cooked meals are best. Do you cook?”

“

“I came here because I liked the small-town atmosphere, and the potential for a holistic approach to patient care. I've grown to really love it.”

Fall




“

“Have you been going into the mines, [Player]? It's a dangerous place. I recommend against it.”

Winter




“

“It's flu season, so you'd better be extra careful. Make sure to wash your hands often.”





“

“I hate to say this, but I do make a lot more money during flu season. I guess if people stopped getting sick, I'd be out of business. Don't get the wrong idea! I want people to be healthy... really!”


At Ginger Island

8+ Hearts




“

“

“You have a really healthy glow. That's good.”





“

“It's a lot of work, being a doctor. I don't eat as well as I should. If I didn't live alone I think it would be easier.”





“

“*Sigh*... I'm starting to feel kind of old... The older you get the more memories you're burdened with. It can be overwhelming. I think I'll stay younger with you around.”

“I'm dreaming of our warm fire back home...”


Feast of the Winter Star




“

“I'm thankful there were no medical emergencies this year!”


If married:




“

“I'm feeling a little overwhelmed... thank goodness for this crisp air...”






After Marriage 



Indoor Days




“

“I think we're all striving to reach some kind of balance in life. An equilibrium of complexity. For me, moving here was exactly what my body needed to find that balance.”





“

“I'm going to study the medical literature today. It's important for me to keep up-to-date so I can give my patients the best care possible!”





“

“I'm going to listen to some jazz music and finalize my medical reports today. What do you have planned?”





“

“I was afraid of you when we first met. It's funny to think about now that we've come so far.”





“

“The sky looks great today... so clear! From now on, I'm only going to go into the clinic when I have appointments. Otherwise I can just work from home!”





“

“Hi (affectionate nickname)! I got up early and fed all the farm animals. I hope it makes your job a little easier today.”





“

“I wonder who lived here before us?”


Giving Complete Breakfast




“

“Good morning, [Player]! I made you a nutritious breakfast. Eggs are a good source of essential nutrients, so eat up.”


In his side room




“

“No air-traffic this morning, honey. But it’s still fun to break out the equipment now and then. I’m working on a new model plane. It’s so much more relaxing here than in my old apartment.”


Outdoor Days




“

“This is a very safe spot. You go on ahead and take care of business, don't worry about me.”





“

“I believe this must be the ideal place to raise children, scientifically. What do you think?”





“

“I may not be the most exciting guy, but I'll stay loyal to you for the rest of my life.”





“

“[Player]... you... you mean the world to me.”





“

“As a scientist I'm fascinated by the delicate interplay of insect and plant life.”





“

“This is so much nicer than being cooped up in the clinic all day. I love watching you on the farm... hehe”


On Patio




“

“You know, this 'journal of tendon dynamics' is actually bearable when I'm reading out here.”


Indoor Nights




“

“You look exhausted, dear. Let me give you a massage tonight. I promise it will reduce the inflammation in your muscle tissue!”





“

“I took it easy today... spent some time reading books, fiddled with my radio, and worked on a model airplane. It's important to take a day off now and then to relax... stress is unhealthy.”





“

“Good evening... did you finish everything you needed to do today? Don't worry about me. I'm very self-sufficient. If you have more work to do go right ahead.”





“

“It's stressful to be a doctor, so it's really great to live somewhere as relaxing as [farm name] Farm.”





“

“Oh! I was just daydreaming about the circulatory system and forgot what I was trying to do. It's a classic doctor's problem.”





“

“You look like you could use a good massage tonight. Doctor's orders... It's good for the circulation!”


Rainy Days




“

“It's a myth that rainy weather causes the flu. However, take care that you don't slip on the mud! I often worry about you.”





“

“It was so incredibly lonely living above the clinic by myself... I'm much happier now.”





“

“I woke up early, but I made sure not to wake you. You looked so peaceful.”





“

“I don't mind the rain. Sure, I can't watch the planes go by, but I can still listen to the radio chatter. It makes the whole thing a little more mysterious.”





“

“I have a backlog of house chores I want to complete today. I've got plenty to keep me busy!”





“

“Make sure you stay dry today, dear. I don't want you to become hypothermic.”


Rainy Nights




“

“How was your day, honey? I was going to do the dishes but I got absorbed in the latest issue of "Knee Surgery Enthusiast".”





“

“If you're enjoying life, who cares if it's a little repetitive? That's what I say.”





“

“You look a little soggy, [hun/dear]. Why don't you warm yourself by the fire?”





“

“The sound of rain gives our minds something to focus on, so we're not distracted by random thoughts. That's my theory for why it's so soothing...”





“

“Hi. It's good to see you. I spent the day skimming through some medical journals.”


Giving dinner




“

“I made us a nice healthy dinner. Only fresh, wholesome ingredients from the valley! Just make sure to eat a reasonable portion, dear.”


Going Out




“

“I think I'll take a little walk today. I need to unwind.”





“

“I had a nice day. It's refreshing to spend some time alone now and then. Did you have a good day, honey?”


Pierre's General Store




“

“Hi! I'm just shopping for some essentials, so I can continue to cook healthy meals for us.”


On Tuesdays and Thursday's




“

“I have to go into the clinic today. Have a nice day, okay?”





“

“Hi, honey. How was your day? *Phew*... I'm exhausted... My patients are still healthy, so it was a good day.”


High Hearts




“

“[Player]...I still can't believe we're married...”





“

“You rescued me from a life of loneliness, and filled the emptiness in my heart. Thank you.”





“

“I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here.”





“

“Be careful out there! I have nightmares about your limp body being wheeled into the emergency room.”





“

“This place is my home now... I'm happy here.”


If male




“

“Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave?”


If female




“

“Oh, my... you look beautiful today.”


When pregnant




“

“(Farmer's name), we're going to have a baby soon.”





“

“ I was afraid of you when we first met. It's funny to think about now that we've come so far.”





“

“Dear, I filed our adoption papers. Now all we can do is cross our fingers and wait.”





“

“(Farmer's name), I hope our adoption request gets approved. I want a baby.”





“

“[Term of endearment], can't you tell? You're pregnant.”


After having one child




“

“You and (baby's name) are the most important parts of my life.”





“

“Little [child] is going to have the perfect childhood here. We're really fortunate to have this opportunity.”





“

“So far, I really like being a father!”





“

“Don't worry, I'll feed (baby's name) today. You can just focus on running the farm.”


After having two children




“

“I already gave [child] and [child] their breakfasts. I'm trying to teach them to enjoy healthy food!”





“

“I believe a child should be allowed to play and explore to their heart's content. You're only a kid once.”





“

“Maybe [child] will grow up to become a pilot, like I never could?”





“

“My life is devoted to you and the children now, and I'm very happy about it. I always dreamed of having a wonderful family. I had nightmares of being a bachelor forever.... I love you so much.”

Summer




“

“Make sure you don't get sunburnt, honey... That can really damage your skin.”

Day before the Luau




“

Fall 1

Day before the Stardew Valley Fair




“

“Tomorrow's the fair. The food is very rich and salty, but I'm fine with splurging once in a while.”


Day before Spirit's Eve




“

“I'll admit, the spirit's eve festival usually gives me intestinal pain... but I'll do my best to be brave.”

Quests
Harvey may randomly request an item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store.  The reward is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
Portraits



































































Timeline
Harvey's look evolved over the years the game was in development.
Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Harvey's style changed over the years before the game was launched.


Trivia
 Harvey's coordinates
During the eight-heart event in his room, he mentions that his coordinates are 52 North, 43.5 East.  In the real world, this would put his location in southwest Russia, between Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
When married to the player, he may admit a fondness for jazz music, as he listens to it when finalizing his medical reports.
Despite telling others to eat healthily, his fridge is filled with convenience food and his microwave oven is well-used.
Inside the Clinic, you can find several plaques on the wall. One states that the clinic is licensed by the Ferngill Republic Health Authority. Another is an advertisement for proper sneeze etiquette. A third in the back is an advertisement for a fictional drug Pravoloxinone which has the side-effect of "Complete disintegration of one or more bones" for 1 in 500 patients. Yet another near the back right of the clinic is described as a "The sign of the vessel", meant to comfort any patients believing in Yoba.
You can dig through the Clinic's trashcans, one of which contains used medical supplies such as syringes.
Harvey's radio has a tape inside of it named "Anthology of Classic Jazz", and his TV is set to the history station.
In the left-most corner of Harvey's apartment, there's a poster stated to be a "comparison between fighter planes of the Ferngill Republic and the Gotoro Empire".
In Secret Note #7, it is confirmed that he is one of three 'older bachelors' in Pelican Town.
Despite loving Coffee, he only likes the Triple Shot Espresso.
Bugs
If you exit Harvey's bedroom after raising his friendship to 8 hearts, his 8 heart cut scene will trigger, but the farmer will be facing the wrong way, causing the game to soft lock. Skipping the cut scene will release the player.
History
1.0: Introduced.
1.1: Added reading garden area behind farmhouse if married.
1.3.27: Added group 10-heart event.
1.4: Added 14 heart event.  Now goes to the Museum on Saturdays.  Now dislikes many cooked dishes.  Fixed bug where viewing the 10-heart event while a train passed would soft-lock the game. Now goes to the Stardrop Saloon at night.
1.5: Added beach portraits.
