Quotes


Regular 



First Meeting




“

“Ah, yes. I have predicted your arrival a long time ago, young [Player]. However, your fate is ultimately in your own hands.”


Regular




“

“Ah, yes. I have seen many things about your future, young [Player]. If I were to tell you, there could be grave consequences.”





“

“If you have nothing important to tell me, leave me be. I have much work to do.”





“

“It takes years of study to understand the language of the elementals. To actually speak their language requires a lifetime of devoted effort. Now, if you'll excuse me...”





“

“There are many mysteries around us. You must be patient if you wish to discover them.”





“

“I believe the townsfolk are afraid of me. It is unfortunate, but I suppose it is human to be afraid of the unknown.”





“

“Beware, you are standing above a potent magical field. I built my hut right here on purpose, you know.”





“

“Have you made any headway with the forest spirits?”





“

“I sometimes observe the local villagers in secret. I am hoping to find an apprentice. Some day I will leave this mortal plane, but my arcane pursuits must continue.”


4+ Hearts




“

“I trust you enough to allow you in my basement. Treat what you find there with respect.”


6+ Hearts




“

“I was married, long ago. After my wife and I split, she began flying around the countryside, cursing everything she saw. It's not a very mature way to express one's anger.”


10 Hearts




“

“You musn't tell anyone... but I have reason to believe that one of the locals is actually my daughter... I could be mistaken... It's rare, but it does happen.”





Events 



Note: The Wizard is not always accessible at festivals. Regardless, he has unique dialogue for each.
Egg Festival




“

“Hmm... And what about raw lizard egg sprinkled with blackened marrow?”


Flower Dance




“

“You shouldn't be up here.”


The Luau




“

“The merpeople are curious about your festivities. They become upset when you litter into the ocean.”


Dance of the Moonlight Jellies




“

“How did you find me back here? I thought I was well-hidden. Perhaps you are blessed with the gift of clairvoyance. I'm here to observe the Lunaloos... or 'Moonlight Jellies', as you call them. They possess an unusually potent magical aura for an aquatic life form.”


Stardew Valley Fair




“

“Welwick and I have known each other for a long time... she is a remarkable diviner, and a good friend.
...That clown... I know him from somewhere. Was it the school of illusion? Or maybe the Carnival of Secrets? Hmm...”



Spirit's Eve
Although you cannot reach the Wizard to see the dialogue in-game, he has dialogue scripted in underlying data files.




“

“The affairs of mundane folk matter little to me, but the elementals like a chance to see you up close. It was for them that I created this silly maze.”


Festival of Ice




“

“Sneaking off to visit my weird tower? You're odd for a mundane.”


Feast of the Winter Star
Although the Wizard does not attend the Feast, he has dialogue scripted in underlying data files.




“

“Ah, the mysterious Winter Star. One of the reasons I chose this valley as the location for my... research.”



Quests


 
Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

"Meet the Wizard": The morning after examining the golden scroll in the Crafts Room of the Community Center, the Wizard will send you a letter saying he has information for you.  Visit the Wizard's Tower and he will give you a potion that allows you to read the language of the Junimos.
"A Dark Reagent": The Wizard will send you a letter on the 12th of Winter requesting that you bring him a Void Essence.  The reward is  1,000g and 1 Friendship heart.
"Staff of Power": The Wizard will send you a letter on the 5th of Winter, year 2, requesting that you bring him an Iridium Bar.  The reward is  5,000g and 1 Friendship heart.
"Dark Talisman": After completing the Community Center Bundles or the Joja Community Development Form, trigger a cutscene at the Railroad, where the Wizard will request that you find a Dark Talisman.  Speak to Krobus in The Sewers, who will remove the force-field blocking the entrance to the Mutant Bug Lair.  Obtain the Dark Talisman from a chest in the Mutant Bug Lair, then bring it back to the Railroad area and place it on the artifact blocking the cave. Inside the cave is a teleportation rune which leads to the Witch's Swamp.  This unlocks The "Goblin Problem" Quest.
"Goblin Problem":  Once inside the Witch's Swamp, the Witch's Henchman will be blocking the way to the Witch's Hut. He will only allow the player to pass if he is given Void Mayonnaise, which completes the quest Goblin Problem and gives access to the Dark Shrines inside the Witch's Hut. Recover the Magic Ink inside the Witch's Hut, then bring the ink back to the Wizard, who will unlock six Wizard buildings for The Farm.
The Wizard may request that you slay a certain number of Monsters or bring him a random item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store.  The reward for slaying monsters varies by the number/type of monster, but is always an amount of gold.  The reward for an item delivery quest is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
The Wizard is to be gifted the Arctic Shard in The Pirate's Wife quest.
"A Curious Substance": On the Special Orders board in front of the Mayor's Manor, the Wizard may randomly request that the player obtain and bring him an Ectoplasm. The reward is  2,500g and the Mini-Obelisk recipe.
"Prismatic Jelly": On the Special Orders board in front of the Mayor's Manor, the Wizard may randomly request that the player obtain and bring him a Prismatic Jelly. The reward is  5,000g and the Monster Musk recipe.
Trivia
Because the door to his house is locked at the start of the game, the Wizard does not count towards the introductions quest.
Introduction to the Wizard normally occurs at his invitation to see him about the Junimos, a part of the preparation for unlocking the Community Center bundles. When you see him at that time, you must play through the entire cutscene. If you do not, the game does not record that you have met him. Although the bundles are still unlocked, friendship and communications with him will not occur until you go to him another time to record the meeting.
The Wizard's Tower is unlocked upon purchasing a Joja membership.  After that, the player must speak with him at any time (including during Festivals) to commence friendship.
Despite being unreachable in most festivals, the Wizard has unique dialogue for every festival, some with backstory on the events.
The Wizard mentions being married for years until he "made a mistake that drove her (his wife) away". The mistake is not specified, but it was enough to turn her "green" out of anger and envy, presumably explaining how she became a witch. Many believe that this "mistake" is having an affair with another villager but this is not confirmed.
The Wizard suspects that one of the villagers is his daughter, asking you not to tell anyone.
Dialogues with Caroline, Pierre, and Abigail heavily imply that this refers to Abigail herself, though other bits of dialogue suggest that her hair was similar to Pierre’s prior to dying it.
There is also some minor evidence that it could be Emily, based on dialogue with Haley, her hair color, and her interest in the spiritual side of the occult.
It is also possible that Jas is his daughter due to her skin tone and natural hair color being similar to the wizard's.
The Wizard's birthday, Winter 17, is the 101st day of the year. This may be a reference to the MMORPG Wizard101.
