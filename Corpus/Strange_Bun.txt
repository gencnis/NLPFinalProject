The Strange Bun is a cooked dish. It is prepared using the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse. 
Strange Bun may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays, in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock or the Garbage Can outside the Saloon, or at the Traveling Cart for 675-1,125g. It may also be dropped by a Shadow Brute (4% chance).
By offering a Strange Bun to the Dark Shrine of Night Terrors in the Witch's Hut, players can toggle monster spawning on or off on their farm.
