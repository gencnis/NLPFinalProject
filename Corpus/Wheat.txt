Wheat is a vegetable crop that grows from Wheat Seeds after 4 days. Wheat is harvested using a Scythe or Golden Scythe. Wheat has a 40% chance to also drop hay when harvested with either Scythe.[1].
In addition to Beer, players have the ability to craft Wheat Flour from Wheat by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one wheat will make one wheat flour. Wheat flour will appear in the box on the right side of the mill the following morning.

Multi-Seasonal Crop
Wheat may be planted in both Summer and Fall. There is no difference in its behavior in either season.
If a Wheat plant (of any growth stage) is in the ground on the 28th of Summer, it will continue growing on the 1st of Fall as though nothing had changed. Fertilizer in the ground underneath a Wheat plant on Summer 28 will not disappear on Fall 1.  Fully-grown wheat plants may be left unharvested until the 1st of Fall to prevent fertilizer and tilled soil from disappearing.

It can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
Wheat may be randomly requested in Summer at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 75g and 150 Friendship points.
Tips
Since wheat grows quickly and can drop hay, it may be beneficial to devote some farmland to growing it, even if the main focus of the farm is raising animals.
