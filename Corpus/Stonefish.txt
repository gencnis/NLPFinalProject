The Stonefish is a fish that can be caught in The Mines on the 20th floor during all seasons. The only other fish that can be caught on the 20th floor of the mines is the Ghostfish. 
The chances of hooking a Stonefish depends on fishing level and on the fishing zone of the spot fished, increasing by 5% if a Curiosity Lure is equipped. For example, at level 10 fishing and fishing zone of 5, the chances of hooking a Stonefish is 7.5%. With a Curiosity Lure equipped, this increases to 12.5%.[1]
The Stonefish and the Octopus are the only fish caught with a fishing rod that cannot be eaten unless used in a recipe.

Tailoring
Stonefish can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the  Fishing Hat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Stonefish can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 5 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. The primary output is dark brown Stonefish Roe, but Copper Ore is possible starting at population 3 and several more valuable items are possible starting at population 9.

References

↑ See MineShaft::getFish in the game code. While Data\Fish.xnb suggests that a fishing level of 3 is needed to hook a Stonefish, the data in MineShaft::getFish, which does not have any level conditions, overrides it. This means that there is no fishing level requirement to hook a Stonefish.


History
1.4: Added iridium quality.  Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.5: Chance of catching it can now be increased by using a Curiosity Lure.
