Joja Cola is a type of trash that can be caught using a Fishing Pole during all seasons, in any location. Players trying to intentionally catch Joja Colas have a better chance at a trash-only location (i.e., a Farm Pond on the Standard Farm Map), or when casting close to the shore.
It can also be purchased for 75g from JojaMart or from the Vending Machine in The Stardrop Saloon. It can be found in any Garbage Can, with a higher chance in the JojaMart Garbage Can.
Players who choose to complete the Joja Warehouse instead of the Community Center will be rewarded with a Soda Machine that produces one Joja Cola per day.
Unlike other trash items, Joja Cola cannot be obtained from Crab Pots or Fish Ponds; it also cannot be recycled.

Bundles
Joja Cola is not used in any bundles.

Recipes
Joja Cola is not used in any recipes.

Tailoring
Joja Cola is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a  Shirt. It is a blue dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the blue dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in dyeing.

Quests
Joja Cola may be randomly requested during any season at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 75g and 150 Friendship points. Ironically, Pierre may request this item.
If the player chooses to purchase it instead of Fishing for it, the cost will be 75g, the same as the quest reward, netting a gain of 0g. However, it might still be worth doing it for the Friendship points.
Trivia
Joja Cola was featured in strip #33 of a series of webcomics called Wumbus World, created by ConcernedApe in 2011. The newspaper ad it was featured in showed a pink can with a blue label and had the following text: "TRY NEW JOJA COLA! Now with 3x more aspartame for a sweet blast."
The Joja Cola slogan is "Fuel your life."
Joja Cola was added to the game Terraria with ConcernedApe's permission in October 2022.
History
1.4: Can now be used in Tailoring.
