Upgrades
You can upgrade your tools at the Blacksmith in exchange for gold and metal bars, with upgrades taking two days to complete. During the upgrade, you can't buy anything or ask Clint to break open geodes. Tools must be upgraded in ascending order of materials; for example, a copper tool can't be upgraded directly to iridium.
Tips:

The practical meaning of an upgrade "taking two days to complete" is that you will wake up on two successive days without your tool. You may use the tool during the day, then take it to the Blacksmith (before it closes) to upgrade.  The next day you will be without your tool.  The following day, you must travel to the Blacksmith to pick up the tool, and can use it for the remainder of the day.
When a tool has completed upgrading, a message will appear in the lower left corner of the screen when waking up for the day.
Enchantments
Main article: Enchantments



Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.


A random enchantment can be added to any melee weapon or tool, with the exceptions of the Copper Pan, Scythe, Golden Scythe, and Trash Can. This costs one  Prismatic Shard and 20  Cinder Shards.
Each weapon or tool can only have one enchantment, and the applied enchantment is random. However, another Prismatic Shard can be used to re-randomize it. Tools track the previous two enchantments applied to them so they're not reselected when reapplying an enchantment.
Upgrading a tool keeps its enchantment.
Enchantments are randomized based on the number of times any tool has been enchanted, so reloading the day and enchanting a different tool will change the progression.

Proficiency
Proficiency refers to the amount of energy required to use a specific tool.
At skill level 0, each successful use of a Pickaxe, Axe, or Hoe costs 2 energy. Unsuccessful uses (e.g., attempting to chop a Large Log with the starter axe) cost 1 energy. Each cast of the Fishing Pole costs 8 energy, even if the cast fails (e.g., the fishing line does not land in water). The starter Watering Can uses 2 energy.
Each increase in skill decreases energy requirements by 0.1 points for specific tools (listed below). Skill increases past level 10 (only possible temporarily via Buffs) continue to decrease the energy requirements.  So, for example, using a Pickaxe at Mining level 13 costs only 0.7 points per swing. (The game keeps track of fractional amounts of energy, but in the user interface they are rounded to the nearest integer.)
Powering up an upgraded Watering Can increases its energy cost by 2 points per power-up; each increase in skill decreases the energy requirement by 0.1 points (regardless of power level). At Farming Level 0, the starter can uses 2 energy to water one tile; the iridium can at maximum power uses 10 energy to water eighteen tiles.  At Farming Level 10, the starter can uses 1 energy; the iridium at maximum power uses 9 energy (10 minus 0.1 per skill level). Using an upgraded can to water fewer tiles than it is able costs the same energy as the first watering can upgrade that is able to water that many tiles (single tile always the same as starter can, 5 tiles always the same as steel can). Attempting to use an empty watering can doesn't cost energy. Filling a watering can never uses energy.
Upgrading an Axe, Pickaxe, or Hoe does not alter the amount of energy required to use it. The increased power of the Axe and Pickaxe and increased area-of-effect of the Hoe will result in less overall energy used for the same task than a lower-level tool.  
Note that all Hoes use the same energy (2 points at Farming Level 0, and 1 point at Farming Level 10), whether powered-up or used to till one tile of soil.
All fishing poles use the same energy:  8 points at Fishing Level 0, and 7 points at Fishing Level 10.

Tool Disposal
Most tools cannot be put in the trash can on the player's inventory screen, or dragged off the inventory screen to be dropped.  Tools that can be trashed and/or dropped are:  all Fishing Poles, the Auto-Grabber, Heater, and Copper Pan.
If the player somehow loses the Scythe, Axe, Pickaxe, or Watering Can (by dying in the mines for example), the next day a basic version of the tool will appear next to the player's bed, in the player's refrigerator (if the player has a kitchen), or in the Lost and Found box in the Mayor's Manor.  Mayor Lewis may send a letter in the mail saying he found them and returned them.

Bugs
In multiplayer, it is possible to lose a tool in the mines, and never get a replacement back. A known workaround for this bug is to have one of the non-hosting players create a new character, have them drop their tools into a chest, and then quit and re-join as their original character.
When swinging a pickaxe, axe, or hoe at one of the cactuses in Calico Desert, the tool disappears from the animation.
If the player triggers a fishing rod away from a fishing spot, it may freeze the player in place. This disables all menus and the game cannot be saved or exited without force.
