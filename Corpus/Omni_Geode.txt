Tailoring
Omni Geode is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Omni Shirt.  

Quests
2-3 Omni Geodes may be requested by Octopus, Rainbow Trout, Spook Fish, Sturgeon, or Super Cucumber in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 5 to 7.

Notes
By multiplying the sell price of each item by the chance to obtain it and how many you would receive on average (with ores, clay and stone) and adding those products together, you can find the average profit of breaking open a single Omni Geode.
The first 15 Omni Geodes that you open have an average value of 114.1g, or 89.1g when the 25g opening cost is factored in.
With the Gemologist Profession, Omni Geodes have an average return of 139.5g, or 114.5g when the 25g opening cost is factored in.
After that, Omni Geodes have an average value of 121.4g, or 96.4g when the 25g opening cost is factored in.
With the Gemologist Profession, Omni Geodes have an average return of 149g, or 124g when the 25g opening cost is factored in, which means that it is always worth it to process Omni Geodes.
