“

“I'm just working at Gus' to make ends meet... but my real passion is tailoring. I made these clothes from scratch.”


— Emily


Emily is a villager who lives in Pelican Town.  She is one of the twelve characters available to marry.  Her home is south of the town square, right next to Jodi's house, at the address 2 Willow Lane. She works most evenings at The Stardrop Saloon starting at about 4:00 PM. 
Emily loves to make her own clothing, but fabric can be difficult to come by in town. Among her favorite gifts are cloth and wool.

Relationships
Emily lives with her sister Haley, and together they care for their parents' home, who have been traveling the world for the past two years. She works with Gus, who employs her part-time at the saloon. She is also friends with Sandy, the two mention each other in dialogues, and she visits The Calico Desert on Sandy's birthday each year. Sandy, at her first meeting with the player, claims to have been aware of the farmer's presence even before access to The Calico Desert was opened, saying that Emily had written to her about the newcomer.
Several dialogues and cutscenes reveal that Clint has romantic interest in Emily, though he is too shy to tell her.

Two Hearts

Enter Emily's house.



Details 


Emily is asleep in her room. The screen pans and fades, and you find yourself viewing Emily's dream. It's a dreamscape of abstract shapes and colors, clouds, and palm trees. Emily floats above a purple stone structure on a large cloud. She is floating, meditating and chanting "power words." You appear out of the cloud, surprising her. She wonders what you are doing in her dream. Rainbow streaks fly by and she sees them as some kind of sign or omen. You disappear and she wakes up. She gets out of bed and says to herself that there is something special about you; she believes that your destinies are somehow intertwined.



Three Hearts

After reaching 3 hearts with Emily she will send you a recipe in the mail.

Four Hearts

Enter town on a sunny day. Cannot be triggered in winter.



Details 


Emily leaves her house on a sunny day. Three parrots fly by, and she waves and refers to them as her "friends". After a moment, she continues walking but quickly stops, confused. A fourth parrot flys in too low and smacks against the window of her house. The parrot is injured. Emily rushes over and cradles the poor thing, promising that she will take care of it. Emily will now have a parrot in her room. The parrot hops around and will squawk if you go up to it and press the "check" button.
(If you marry Emily, the parrot will move into your house as well.)


Six Hearts

Visit Emily's house when she's there.



Details 



You'll enter Emily's room.  She tells you that she is excited to show you her secret hobby that she has been working on for a long time.  She'll then proceed to turn on her stereo and begin dancing for you.  After the lights and music end it will ask you what you thought of the performance. You have three choices:

"That was amazing!" (+25 friendship.)
"That was embarrassing..." (-50 friendship.)
(Say nothing and do a slow clap) (+25 friendship.)
This event was formerly Emily's four heart event, it was changed in version 1.1. In that update it got a new unique song and dialogue, as well as animation and visual improvements.

Eight Hearts

A letter in the mail will invite the player to the Mayor's Manor that same day during open hours.
This event will still be available on subsequent days if you missed it the first day.



Details 


Emily will send you a letter in the Mail, inviting you to attend her "Clothing Therapy" session:



“

“[Player],
I have this crazy new idea that I want to involve
you in... It's called "Clothing Therapy".
Please come to the Mayor's house today to see what
it's all about.
Love, Emily”



Enter the Mayor's house. Emily will explain the purpose is to help the townspeople express their true selves in the form of clothing. Attending are Mayor Lewis, Abigail, Shane, Robin, and Clint. Each one takes a turn going behind the curtain. Emily instructs them to choose whatever clothes "speaks to them", put it on and then show the world without fear. One by one, you get to see each character's choice. Shane puts on a full "goth" outfit. Robin puts on a fine dress and lets her hair down, embracing her feminine side. Mayor Lewis comes out with a fancy hat, cape, and cane. Abigail comes out in a full suit of armor. Clint is apprehensive about the whole thing, but after Emily coaxes him, he goes ahead. He comes out in a button-up shirt, pink shorts and a beret. Emily sees it and says  "Awww... cute!", which makes Clint sad. After he is gone, Emily approaches you with romantic interest. Clint bursts in, saying he's too embarrassed to go out in his new outfit. He sees what's going on and feels awful. He makes some indirect remarks about it and leaves. Emily is confused.


Ten Hearts

A letter will invite the player to meet Emily in the Secret Woods after 10pm that night.
You will need a Steel Axe in order to break the Large Log blocking the entrance to the Secret Woods. If you do not have a Steel axe, do not worry, as the heart event will trigger whenever you next go into the Secret Woods after 10 pm and when it is not raining or a festival day.
After triggering the cut-scene, the night will immediately end for the player.



Details 


You go camping with Emily in the Secret Woods. There is strange grunting coming from the forest. She says it's cold and snuggles up close to you by the fire. A bear comes out of the woods and approaches your campsite. It grunts loudly and you both jump and dive into the tent. The bear sniffs around and leaves. Emily says that one of the sleeping bags is still out there, and she's not willing to go out and get it... so you have to share a bag. You hear movement in the tent, the screen fades and the day ends.
The next day, the player receives a letter from Emily, saying 




“

“Thanks for joining me last night... I had a great time.I'm actually glad that bear showed up!See you soon  Love, Emily”



Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelorettes, raised friendship with each bachelorette to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelorette's 10-heart event, then entering Haley/Emily's House will trigger a cutscene. If Haley is the final bachelorette you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a gossip session about Mayor Lewis and Marnie's relationship.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelorettes will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelorettes will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelorettes will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Exit the farmhouse between 6am and 8:20am.



Details 


Emily will appear outside the farmhouse and provide a quest to bring her 200 pieces of fiber.  The quest is called "Errand for your Wife".
After completing the quest and waiting 3 days, enter the farmhouse between 8pm and midnight.  Emily will give you a new outfit consisting of Emily's Magic Hat, Emily's Magic Boots, Emily's Magic Shirt, and a pair of matching blue Genie Pants.


Marriage
Main article: Marriage
Once married, Emily will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, she will add her own room to the right of the bedroom. She'll also set up a small crystal garden behind the farmhouse where she'll sometimes go to meditate.  Note that Emily's parrot will not be visible to anyone in multiplayer who has not completed her 4 heart event.
On rainy mornings, Emily may offer you Cloth, Wool, Duck Feather, Refined Quartz, or Bean Hotpot.  On rainy nights, she may offer you dessert that is "raw", "gluten-free", and "sweetened only with cactus syrup":  Rice Pudding, Blueberry Tart, Cookie, or Chocolate Cake.  On days when Emily stays inside the farmhouse all day, she may offer you Cloth, Wool, Duck Feather, Refined Quartz, Bean Hotpot, Coffee, or an Omni Geode.

“I never told you this... but when you first moved here I had a dream about you. I knew right then that our life-paths would intertwine.”





“

“I know you pride yourself on your work, but don't overdo it today. Okay, honey?”


Giving gift




“

“Good morning... I got this gift for you. Don't worry, I already purified it with sage incense.”


Rainy Nights




“

“Every moment has a unique and precious beauty... do you notice? It can be easy to forget, sometimes.”





“

“I can hear the plants talking to each other... they're so happy after today's rain!”





“

“How was your day, [Player]? You look a little soggy.”





“

“My day was very peaceful. How was yours?”





“

“Does the sound of rain ever put you in a trance?”





“

“Certain spirits only appear in the rain. Maybe you've heard their cries?”


Giving food




“

“Want some dessert? It's my special raw, gluten-free version, sweetened only with cactus syrup.”


Going Out




“

“I'm going to visit town today, and later on I'm going to help out at the saloon. Have a nice day.”


While working at the Saloon




“

“Gus seems to have problems organizing everything without me around.”


At home




“

“My day went well... it's good to get out of the house now and then.”


After having one child




“

“I hope we can raise [child] to be kind and considerate. That's more important than getting A's in school.”





“

“Is one child enough, or should we raise another? I guess we'll just see where fate leads us.”





“

“I lit a pale green candle and shook a sprig of baby-mint over [child]. That should ward off any dangerous spirits”


After having two children




“

“A big house, two kids and a parrot... I have my hands full!”





“

“Well, [child] certainly has your hair...”





“

“Oh, I already fed the kids their organic quinoa puffs with goat milk. You just focus on the farm!”


High Hearts




“

“This is so fun to live together! I always thought I'd be single my whole life.”





“

“It was our destiny to be together... I believe that with all my heart!”





“

“Thanks for taking me into your home. I love this new life.”





“

“Our vibrational energies are perfectly in tune. Can't you feel it?”





“

“I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is beautiful! I can feel the pure blue energy radiating from it.”





“

“I had another dream about us last night. We had climbed to the top of a crystal tree, looking down on the most lush and beautiful meadow. I keep having this dream. I don't know what it means, but I feel that it's a good omen.”


Neutral Hearts




“

“I hope you'll still like me when I grow old and my hair turns to a dull, faded steel.”





“

“I feel uninspired today.”


Spring
Spring 1




“

“Happy new year, honey. Let's make this a special one.”


Spring 2




“

“My friends, the plants, have come back to life. I feel content.”


Spring 22




“

“Hmm... I'm thinking maybe a salad of fresh foraged greens for dinner tonight?”


Summer




“

“Phew! It's hot but it feels great, doesn't it? Maybe we'll see some wild parrots today.”


Summer 2




“

“May Yoba bless you on this lovely day.”


Summer 20




“

“The energy in our bodies fluctuate just as the seasons do. Understanding your own unique rhythm is the first step to inner harmony.”


Fall




“

“I drank a super-food smoothie this morning and I feel aaah-mazing!”


Fall 1




“

“The year's already half-way over. Can you believe it?”


Day before the Stardew Valley Fair




“

“Have you figured out what you're going to use for our grange display tomorrow?”


Fall 25




“

“Our bodies are naturally in tune with the seasons. This light and color of fall compels us to prepare for the barren winter. To our distant ancestors, this feeling was encompassing and vital. For us, it only barely peeks through the noise of modern life.”


Winter




“

“Whoops, my hair is frozen solid again.”


Winter 2




“

“I can't help but think of all the poor, frozen squirrels out there right now.”


Winter 5




“

“*sigh*... Why does there have to be war and hatred in the world?”


Winter 15




“

“On a day like this, I have a craving for cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.”


Winter 28




“

“Thanks for a great year, [Player]. I'm excited to tackle next year together.”


Special Summit Cutscene Dialogue




“

“This is a special moment... I've always known I would be standing here with you, someday. I've always felt it in my heart. Now, it's all come true. The world is a mysterious and special place...”


After Divorce




“

“[Player], you broke my heart... I just can't talk to you anymore...
Please, let me try to heal...”
