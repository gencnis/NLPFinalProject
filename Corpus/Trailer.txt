Trailer








Open Hours:

9:00am - 8:00pm


Address:

Pelican Town

 Pam Penny


The Trailer is the home of Pam and Penny and is located east of the Saloon and north of the Mayor's Manor.
It has two rooms in it: Penny's bedroom (which can be accessed when Penny is at two hearts) and the sitting room/kitchen. If the player examines the bin in the lower right corner of the trailer, they will note that it is full of empty beer bottles. Pam can also be found sitting on the couch in the morning complaining about her head.

Interior


Community Upgrade
After fully upgrading the Farmhouse and completing the Community Center (or purchasing a JojaMart membership), players are able to purchase a "Community Upgrade" from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop for 500,000g and 950 Wood.  Robin will then build a new house for Pam (and Penny, if the player is not married to Penny).  Note that only the host player in a multiplayer game is able to purchase this upgrade.  
Once the house is built, entering the town from the Bus Stop will trigger a cutscene during which the player can choose to tell Pam who paid for the home or to remain anonymous.  Regardless of the choice, friendship with Pam will increase by 4 hearts.[1]
Note: Anything placed inside the old house will be lost and unrecoverable as soon as the upgrade completes, as the old interior map will no longer be accessible.
After the house is built, the location on the in-game map changes from "Trailer" to "2 River Road".
