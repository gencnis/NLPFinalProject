Tailoring
Sardine can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Sailor Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Sardines can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The only possible output is blue Sardine Roe.
