Weapon forging
A melee weapon (dagger, hammer, or sword) can be forged up to three times to improve its stats. Each forge costs one gem and 10/15/20 Cinder Shards depending on how many times it was previously forged.
Using a  Diamond as the gem fills all remaining forge levels with random upgrades, but consumes only 10 Cinder Shards.
Note that "level" refers to the number of times a weapon was forged with the specific gem. So for instance, if a weapon was forged with a Ruby, then an Emerald, and then an Amethyst, the weapon stats will have +10% attack power, +2 speed, and +1 weight.



Gem

Effect


 Amethyst

More  knockback (adds 1 per level).


 Aquamarine

More  critical hit chance (adds 4.6% per level).


 Emerald

More  weapon speed (adds 2 on the first and third level, 3 on the second level).


 Jade

More  critical hit damage (adds 10% per level).


 Ruby

More  damage (adds 10% per level to both min and max damage).


 Topaz

More  Defense (adds 1 per level).

Enchantments
A random enchantment can be added to any melee weapon or tool, with the exceptions of the Copper Pan, Scythe, Golden Scythe, and Trash Can. This costs one  Prismatic Shard and 20  Cinder Shards.
Each weapon or tool can only have one enchantment, and the applied enchantment is random. However, another Prismatic Shard can be used to re-randomize it. Tools track the previous two enchantments applied to them so they're not reselected when reapplying an enchantment.
Upgrading a tool keeps its enchantment.
Enchantments are randomized based on the number of times any tool has been enchanted, so reloading the day and enchanting a different tool will change the progression.

Combat enchantments
Only applies to melee weapons (can't be applied to a slingshot)

Infinity Weapons
A Galaxy Soul can be forged into a galaxy weapon at the cost of 20 Cinder Shards. Doing this 3 times (at a total cost of 3 Galaxy Souls and 60 cinder shards) will turn the weapon into a more powerful "Infinity" weapon. Adding just 1 or 2 does not affect the weapon. The weapons keep their enchantments and forgings when they are made into Infinity weapons.

Weapon Appearance
Two weapons can be merged through the forge. The resulting weapon will have all the stats and info of the first weapon, but the appearance of the second weapon. Only weapons of the same type can be merged. Slingshots cannot be merged. The second weapon will be consumed.
This costs 10 Cinder Shards.

Combined Rings
Two different rings can be combined into one with stacked effects. This costs 20 Cinder Shards.
This has two restrictions:

Two of the same ring cannot be combined into one. (However, two different rings with the same effect can be combined, like the Glow Ring and Glowstone Ring. Their effects will stack in the same way as wearing both rings separately.)
Three or more rings cannot be combined into one. (i.e., a combined ring can't be further combined).
Unforge
Weapons and combined rings can be unforged to reset its properties.

For a weapon, unforging removes all forge upgrades (but not enchantments) and resets its appearance.
For a combined ring, unforge splits it back into the original rings.
Unforging is free, but only returns some of the Cinder Shards used to forge the item.
To begin the unforging process, place the item for unforging into the left square slot. Then click the red ⨯ symbol near the bottom right corner. The unforged item(s) will appear in inventory, along with any returned Cinder Shards.

Fishing
The Forge is the only level of the Volcano Dungeon where fishing can occur. It is one of two locations in the game where players can catch Lava Eels. Crab pots cannot be placed in the forge.
There is a 5% chance the player can catch a present that contains the painting 'Physics 101'. This painting can only be caught once per player per game.[2]
If this painting was not caught, the percent chance of hooking a Lava Eel is equivalent to 10 times the fishing zone of the spot fished. Otherwise, Trash will be caught. So for instance, there is a 50% chance to hook a Lava Eel and a 50% chance to hook Trash if the bobber lands in a spot with a fishing zone of 5.[2]

Secrets
After achieving Perfection, a red monkey can be interacted with to obtain a secret hat.
The plaque above the Forge contains an enciphered message.
