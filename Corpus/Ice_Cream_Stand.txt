Ice Cream Stand








Open Hours:

1pm to 5pm during Summer


Closed:

Wednesday •  Rainy days


Address:

Next to the museum


Occupants:

 Alex


The Ice Cream Stand is located directly to the east of the bridge leading towards the Blacksmith shop and the Museum. It is only open during Summer on non-rainy days, when it is not Wednesday, and when Alex is behind the counter from 1pm to 5pm. When it is open, Ice Cream can be purchased, and Haley can often be found next to the stand, making it a good place to look for her during the summer.
If the player marries Alex he will no longer work there and they will not be able to buy Ice Cream. Haley will still go to the shop even if Alex is married.
