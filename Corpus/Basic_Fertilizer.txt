Basic Fertilizer is a Fertilizer that helps by improving soil quality. It can be crafted or purchased from Pierre's General Store for 100g starting on Spring 15th of year 1. [1]
Basic Fertilizer must be placed on tilled soil before a seed has sprouted.
Basic Fertilizer affects only the basic harvest, which means that extra crops gained at a single harvest (i.e., Coffee Bean, Blueberry, Cranberries) will be regular quality.
