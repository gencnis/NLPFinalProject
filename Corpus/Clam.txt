The Clam is an item that can be caught using a Crab Pot in any saltwater body of water. It can also be foraged from The Beach or randomly found at the Traveling Cart for 150-1,000g.
Even though all other Crab Pot creatures are considered to be fish, Clams are not. Therefore, they cannot be used in recipes that call for any fish, cannot be placed in a Fish Pond, do not benefit from the Fisher or Angler professions, and do not count towards the four fishing achievements. They also appear in the collections tab under Items Shipped instead of the Fish section.
