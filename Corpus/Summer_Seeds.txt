Summer Seeds are a type of Crafted seed. The crafting recipe is labeled "Wild Seeds (Su)", but when crafted, the result is "Summer Seeds."  Mature plants yield, at random, a Grape, Spice Berry, or Sweet Pea.  
Summer Seeds are one of the season-specific crafted wild seeds, along with Spring Seeds, Fall Seeds, and Winter Seeds that produce crops normally found as forage.  While Farming Skill normally increases the chance to grow a quality crop, Foraging Skill increases the chance to grow a quality crop from Summer Seeds. Choosing the Botanist profession will ensure iridium-quality crops grown from Summer Seeds.   
Crows do not attack crops grown from Summer Seeds, so the use of Scarecrows is unnecessary.

Profitability
Summer seeds are a profitable recipe. A craft of Summer seeds yields 10 seeds worth 550g total, while a set of iridium ingredients for Summer Seeds only sells for 420g (436g with the Tiller Profession).

Gallery
Wild Seeds from any season may appear similar to dead crops during Stage 2 of growth.


Bugs
On Ginger Island, mature Summer Seeds may destroy the tilled soil (and fertilizer), leaving untilled soil in their place after harvest.

History
1.4: Can be used in the Tea Sapling recipe.
1.5: Bugfix for stages of growth with Agriculturist + Deluxe Fertilizer.
1.5.6: Dirt under freshly grown seasonal forage seeds no longer disappears randomly, except on Ginger Island.
