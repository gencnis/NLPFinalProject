The Torch is a craftable lighting item that can be held to provide light at night, or in dark areas of The Mines for a radius of approximately 3 tiles. They can also be gathered by using a Hoe, a Pickaxe, or an Axe. Torches can also be placed indoors or outdoors to provide lighting.
When placing a Soggy Newspaper into the Recycling Machine, it can sometimes produce 3 torches.
Torches do not provide as much light as other sources, but they can be walked on by the player. Torches may also be placed on top of Fences.
