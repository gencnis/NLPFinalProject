The Qi Fruit is a fruit crop that grows from Qi Beans after 4 days. This fruit is only available during the "Qi's Crop" quest.
All Qi Fruit and Qi Beans despawn when the quest is over (i.e., the day after the player ships them or the quest timer ends), including growing crops, all players' inventories, chests, Preserves Jars, Kegs, and Marlon's item recovery service list.
Qi Fruit is always normal quality.

Bundles
Qi Fruit is not used in any bundles.

Quests
Mr. Qi requests the player to ship 500 Qi Fruit in 28 days in the "Qi's Crop" quest.  The reward is  100.
Tailoring
Qi Fruit is used in the spool of Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a  Qi Mask. It can be placed in the blue dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in dyeing.

Notes
Although Qi Fruit benefits from the Tiller Profession, its sell price with the extra 10% is 1.1g, which is truncated to 1g in the game code.
Finishing the Qi's Crop quest does not remove Qi Fruit in Pierre's General Store stock. Extra Qi Fruit can be sold to the General Store before completing the quest and bought back the next day for 1g each. This makes future Qi's Crop quests significantly easier. It is possible that Villagers may purchase some of the Qi fruit, resulting in fewer fruit to buy back.
History
1.5: Introduced.
1.5.2: Can now be grown on the farm during Winter.
1.5.3: Qi Fruits are now properly removed from any machines/craftables and from Marlon's item recovery service after the Qi Challenge expires.
