“

“Pam and Clint come into the saloon almost every night. I'd probably go out of business if they stopped coming. So make sure you don't drive them away!”


— Gus


Gus is a villager who lives and works at The Stardrop Saloon in Pelican Town.  He owns the establishment.

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Gus may randomly spend the day there. (He will leave a cash box on the bar, so the player is still able to make purchases.) After leaving the Island at 6pm, Gus will tend bar until 12:30am, when he goes to bed. Gus never visits the Resort on Festival days or his checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.

Dear (Player),Here's a recipe from my saloon. I only share this with my good friends!-Gus


Four Hearts


Enter the Saloon during open hours, when Gus is inside.  Note:  Only occurs if your friendship with Pam is at 2 hearts or more.


Details 


When you enter the bar, Gus will be sitting at one of the tables looking dejected. When you ask what's wrong, he'll tell you that the saloon is having hard times financially. He'll admit that at least one problem is that Pam isn't paying off her tab and he's afraid to confront her because they are friends. Pam will then enter and ask for a drink. Gus will be flustered and concede, but you will get the choice to either say:
You need to pay your tab right now! (-50 friendship.)
The saloon isn't doing well, financially (+15 friendship.) Pam will be somewhat upset but she will pay her tab off and Gus will give her the drink she asked for.
Your relationship with Pam will not be affected either way


Five Hearts

Exit the farmhouse on a non-rainy day between 6am and 11:30am



Details 


Gus appears with a pot of sauce.  He draws an analogy between cooking and the player's appearance in Stardew Valley, saying that adding a new ingredient may ruin the sauce or create something new and delicious.  He explains that he's come to think of the player as a good friend, and says he found an old Mini-Jukebox while cleaning the Saloon.  He gives the player the jukebox, and the recipe to make more.

Seven Hearts

After reaching seven hearts with Gus he will send you a recipe in the mail.

“

“Emily's been working here for a while now. I don't know what I'd do without her! I would hate to have to clean all those pots by myself.”





“

“Pam and Clint come into the saloon almost every night. I'd probably go out of business if they stopped coming. So make sure you don't drive them away!”





“

“Hi there, [Player]. If you're ever thirsty, the Saloon is the place the be.”

“Hi there [Player]. I'm glad to see you! You're always welcome here.”





“

“

“It's a fine art, making candy canes. You've really got to search far and wide for the best ingredients. They aren't easy to come by these days! I usually use Fern Island Ringfruit for my premier canes, you know. You can't beat that bright red coloring... And it's all natural! Oh, you want to know the secret to my deluxe double-canes? Okay, but you've got to promise absolute secrecy. *whisper* It's a drop of vanilla in the white candy to complement the cherry flavor. Of course, peppermint candy canes are the standard, and I always make a healthy batch of those as well.
Hey, you look like you're falling asleep. Are you okay?”
