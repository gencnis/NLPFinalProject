 Fortune Teller
Luck  is a statistic that affects many different aspects of the game, such as the drop rates of geodes and chance of getting treasure from Fishing.  There are several sources of luck:  daily luck determined by the game, buffs gained from eating certain food and drink, a Special Charm which gives a small permanent luck boost, and the Lucky Ring.

Daily Luck
The base value for daily luck is a randomly generated number from -0.1 to 0.1.[1] The value is increased by 0.025 with the Special Charm. Daily luck does not change if the day is restarted, but it can change by replaying the previous day.
Daily luck can be checked by right-clicking on the Television and selecting "Fortune Teller."  The Fortune Teller will give an indication of the daily luck stat modifier. Luck is not affected by viewing the Fortune Teller Television Program (i.e., the luck value is not neutral if the player does not view the program, the luck value remains constant regardless.)
Before revealing the luck message, one of the following messages is shown randomly (the first two being gender-specific). They do not affect the luck in any way.




“

“Ah... I sense that a new viewer has joined us. A young man from... Stardew Valley? Welcome, welcome!”





“

“Ah... I sense that a new viewer has joined us. A young lady from... Stardew Valley? Welcome, welcome!”





“

“Ah... yes, I can hear the spirits whispering something to me... ”





“

“Welcome back to 'Welwick's Oracle'... If you seek hidden knowledge of the future, well you've come to the right place.”





“

“Hoo.. I see a glimmer within my scrying orb... A shard of knowledge from the future!”





“

“Welcome to Welwick's Oracle... the ONLY show where the voice of the spirits is channeled directly... to YOU.”

Daily Luck Effects
Daily luck affects the following:

Mining
Chance to discover ladders from breaking rocks while Mining.
Geode and coal drop chance from rocks.
(Luck does not increase the chance to receive rare minerals and artifacts from breaking geodes. These results depend only on the save file and the sequence in which the geodes are broken.)
Chance of finding Gem Nodes and Mystic Stones in The Mines or Skull Cavern.
Chance that crates spawn in The Mines.
Chance to find treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern.
Amount of gold and items lost when dying in The Mines or Skull Cavern.
Chance of finding Radioactive Nodes in The Mines (while the Shrine of Challenge is active) or Skull Cavern (while Skull Cavern Invasion is active). [3]
Other
Chance of treasure chests appearing while Fishing.
Chance of getting special items (e.g., Neptune's Glaive, Prismatic Shard, Iridium Band).
Chance to double the number of crops yielded at harvest. Works for any crop, and a unique "dwoop" sound effect plays if this occurs as the result of a luck-based check. [4]
Drop chance of Duck Feather and Rabbit's Foot from animals.
Amount of wood dropped from trees.
Quality and number of ores obtained from panning.
Chance of getting a second item (in addition to ore) from panning.
Chance of getting items from Garbage Cans and the chance the item is not trash.
Chance the spouse will be jealous after giving a gift to another marriage candidate that the player is also currently dating.
Results of playing slots at the Casino.
Amount of lightning during a storm (higher luck increases the amount of lightning). [5]
Luck Buffs



Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

In addition to Daily Luck, Luck Buffs gained from eating food will provide temporary bonuses.  Any luck buff is treated separately from daily luck, so the effects of the two types of luck are not automatically the same; both the types of events affected by luck buffs and the magnitude of the effect can be different. Only one drink-derived buff and one food-derived buff can be active at a given time.
Known differences between daily luck and luck buffs include:

The drop chances of Duck Feather and Rabbit's Foot are not improved by luck buffs.
For Fishing Treasure Chest contents, a luck buff does not improve special item chances.  Instead, it increases the chance of getting double quantities of resources and gems.  It also allows standard rings (Glow Ring, Magnet Ring) to appear in place of small rings (Small Glow Ring, Small Magnet Ring).
The following food and drink provide a temporary luck buff:
