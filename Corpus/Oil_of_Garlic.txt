 Combat Level 6


Ingredients:

 Garlic (10) Oil (1)

Oil of Garlic is a drinkable crafted item. The recipe is earned at Combat skill level 6. The Dwarf also sells Oil of Garlic for 3,000g each.
Drinking Oil of Garlic gives the Oil of Garlic Buff which lasts for 10 minutes (real-time). The Oil of Garlic Buff prevents enemies from spawning in The Mines, except on Dungeon Floors.[1] In Skull Cavern, it prevents floors from being infested, which includes Prehistoric Floors[2], and also prevents swarms of monsters on any level[3]. The Buff has no effect in Dangerous Mines or Dangerous Skull Cavern.[4]
It is a special-effect buff, meaning that drinking Oil of Garlic will not remove any buffs from other drinks, or vice-versa.
Note: this recipe is profitable - it will always result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients.
