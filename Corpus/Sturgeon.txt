The Sturgeon is a fish that can be caught in the mountain lake and Wilderness Farm during Summer and Winter. It is least common during rainy winter days (only possible by using a Rain Totem) and most common on rainy summer days, comprising from 11% to 16% of all items caught. It is most likely to be caught when casting farther from shore.[1] It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Wednesdays for 200g, or at the Traveling Cart for 600-1,000g.
Sturgeon can be caught regardless of time of day or season using Magic Bait.

Tailoring
Sturgeon can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Vest.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Sturgeon can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. The only possible output is Sturgeon Roe, which can be put into a Preserves Jar to make Caviar.
