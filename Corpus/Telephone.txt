Sell Price:

Cannot be sold


The Telephone is a piece of equipment that allows players to check store hours and inventory.[1] It can be purchased from the Carpenter's Shop for 2,000g. It may be placed anywhere in Stardew Valley, indoors or out.
Phone calls that can be received include scam phone calls, calls from the bear from Bear's Knowledge, from Vincent, Lewis, or Pierre, from the hat mouse, or a message in a foreign language.[2]
Calling a merchant does not affect friendship points and does not count as talking to that villager for the day.

Bugs
If the player calls a merchant and checks the store stock while that merchant is away on Ginger Island, the store interface may use the merchant's island portrait.
It is possible to use the phone to call a merchant while inside their own store. They will have no reaction to this.
