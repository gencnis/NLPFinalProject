Ingredients:

 Wood (1)


The Wood Path is a crafted decor item. It is used to create decorative paths on the farm.  It can be displaced by lightning or destroyed by weeds.
The recipe is already in the player's inventory when the game starts.
All types of pathing provide a +0.1 boost to Player Speed, but only if it is located outside on The Farm. They also have the indirect benefit of preventing Grass or Trees from growing in heavily used areas, which would otherwise slow down or obstruct movement.
