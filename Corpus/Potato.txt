Tailoring
A Potato can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Shirt And Belt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
The Potato may be randomly requested in Spring at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 240g and 150 Friendship points.
Notes

↑ The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.2, then another Potato will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.2, at which point the chance for an extra Potato ends. This, on average, will give 0.25 extra Potatoes. Keep in mind that Daily Luck can also double the amount of extra Potatoes spawned by the above formula.


History
1.4: Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.5: Iridium quality is now possible when using Deluxe Fertilizer.
