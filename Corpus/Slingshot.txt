The Slingshot is a slingshot weapon that can be obtained from the chest on level 40 of The Mines. After that, it can be purchased at the Adventurer's Guild for 500g. Despite its description, many items other than Stone can be used as Slingshot ammunition.
Unlike most weapons, using a slingshot on a villager will decrease friendship with them by 30 points.  Using a slingshot on the cat or dog will produce a "hate" dialogue bubble, but will not decrease friendship. 

Ammunition
To equip a slingshot with ammunition, select the ammunition, then Right-Click on the slingshot.
The type of ammunition used determines the damage dealt, according to the following formulas :

Slingshot:
Damage = AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1]
Master Slingshot:
Damage = 2 * (AmmoMultiplier + random number between [-(AmmoMultiplier / 2), AmmoMultiplier + 1])
With the worst ammo (i.e., Fruits, Vegetables, or Eggs), a Slingshot can deal 1-3 and a Master Slingshot can deal 2-6 damage. With the best ammo, Iridium Ore, a Slingshot can deal 25-101 damage while a Master Slingshot can deal 50-202 damage.
The following items can be used as ammunition:
