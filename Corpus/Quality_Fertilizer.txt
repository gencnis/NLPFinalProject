Quality Fertilizer is a Fertilizer that improves the chance to grow a quality crop. It can be crafted, obtained from a Bone Mill, or purchased for 150g from Pierre's General Store beginning in year 2.  It may also occasionally be sold by the Traveling Cart (in any year) for 100-1,000g.  Thirty Quality Fertilizer are the reward for completing the  5,000 Bundle in the Vault.
Quality Fertilizer must be placed on tilled soil before a seed has sprouted.
Quality Fertilizer only affects the basic harvest, which means that extra crops gained at harvest (i.e., Coffee Bean, Blueberry, Cranberries) will be of regular quality.

When to turn fish into Quality Fertilizer
Below are quick-reference tables showing when to turn fish into Quality Fertilizer, based on the quality of the fish.  
(The tables consider fish whose sell price is exactly 150g to be not good to turn into Quality Fertilizer, since the addition of the sell price of 2 sap (4g) makes it technically better to purchase Quality Fertilizer.)
