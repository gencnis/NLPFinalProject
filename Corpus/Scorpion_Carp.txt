The Scorpion Carp is a fish that can be caught in the pond at The Desert during all seasons. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans after unlocking The Desert, or at the Traveling Cart for 450-1,000g. The only other fish that can be caught in the Desert is the Sandfish.  
Since it is more valuable than the Sandfish, it is more difficult to catch and also has a lower bite rate.  Catching the Scorpion Carp requires fishing level 4, either naturally or by using fishing Buffs. Other than Legendary Fish, the Scorpion Carp is the only fish where a certain fishing level must be met to hook it.
If the fishing level condition is satisfied, each cast results in a 12-20% chance to hook a Scorpion Carp, with higher chances at higher fishing levels.
Scorpion Carp can be caught regardless of time of day using Magic Bait.

Tailoring
Scorpion Carp can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the  Fishing Hat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Scorpion Carp can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing two quests. The primary output is dark brown Scorpion Carp Roe, but Cactus Seeds are also possible at population 10.
