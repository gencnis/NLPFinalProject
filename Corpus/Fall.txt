↑ The foraged items that can spawn in a given location each season are determined by GameLocation::spawnObjects in the game code, using input from the data file Content\Locations.xnb.  The percentages provided here have been normalized to ensure that the percentages sum to 100% for each location. The data was normalized by:
Calculating the sum of all percentages listed in Locations.xnb for Fall
Dividing each percentage by the sum
