The Dressed Spinner is a tackle that helps fishing by reducing maximum delay before a nibble by 7.5 seconds. It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for 1,000g after reaching Fishing level 8. It can also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests after reaching Fishing level 6, may randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for 1,500-2,500g, and can be obtained as a gift from Willy at the Feast of the Winter Star. 
One Dressed Spinner is the reward for completing the  Lake Fish Bundle. One Dressed Spinner is also one of the rewards the player gets the first time they win the fishing competition at the Festival of Ice.
Only the Iridium Rod can equip tackle. To attach tackle to an Iridium Rod, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the Iridium Rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle.
Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
