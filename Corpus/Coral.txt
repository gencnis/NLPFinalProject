Coral is a forageable item found year-round in the Tide Pool section of the Beach, i.e., to the east of the wooden footbridge[1].  During Summer 12-14, extra Coral appears anywhere on the beach (including possibly the western section).
The average spawn rate for Coral in the tide pool section of the beach is 0.93/day. An additional 3.2 (on average) Coral per day will spawn during Summer 12-14.  These spawn rates are not affected by the presence of other forageable items on the beach; in particular, Coral are not part of the standard six item per map limit on forageable items. 7 Foraging XP are granted for every Coral picked up, and all Foraging bonuses apply to Coral.
Several Crab Pot fish may produce 1 Coral in a Fish Pond when the population of the pond reaches 5.

Tailoring
Coral can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Strapped Top.   It can be also used as a red dye color at the dye pots in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Although Coral is not otherwise considered to be fish, it can be placed in a Fish Pond, where it will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 10 Coral; no quests are necessary to increase the pond capacity. Instead of producing Roe, Coral ponds produce Dolomite and Limestone, but only once the population reaches 9.
