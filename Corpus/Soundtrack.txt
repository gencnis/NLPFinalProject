The Stardew Valley Official Soundtrack (OST) is composed by ConcernedApe. It's available on Steam in select languages and via the official merchandise shop. It's also available through multiple digital music platforms courtesy of ConcernedApe.
The original soundtrack included 70 songs. Songs added to the soundtrack since then:

Four songs from v1.1 in November 2017
Three songs from v1.3 in August 2018
Fourteen songs from v1.4 in November 2019
Nine songs from v1.5 in December 2020
The player can use a Mini-Jukebox on the farm, any interior of a building, or the cave to continously play the music of their choice. Only tracks that have been heard before can be selected.

Triggering Conditions
In addition to the Weather, Season and Time conditions mentionned in the table above, the soundtrack triggering rules are as follows.

Three seasonal tracks exist for each season. Only one can be played on a given day. The track will not loop when finished, but if no music is playing, the track will trigger when entering any seasonal-track area (except for Town, see below, and given the weather and time conditions are met). The same conditions apply to the Ginger Island track.
Some locations are silent, always or on given conditions (cutscenes and ambient sounds apart):
The following location are always silent: Basement Room of the Wizard, Beach, Blacksmith, Casino, Elliott's Cabin, Fish Shop and its back room, Jungle, JojaMart, Mutant Bug Lair, Pirate Cove (when empty), Qi's Walnut Room, Quarry Mine, Sewers, Skull Cavern entrance, Spa, Tunnel, Witch's Hut, Witch's Swamp
The Railroad is silent except during Winter.
Outside areas and most stores are silent during  Rain and  Storm days.
If a non-seasonal-track is playing, and the player enters a seasonal-track area (Town apart), there will be silence (e.g., entering the Forest from Town when the Town theme is playing, exiting the Adventurer's Guild, the Secret Woods, the Wizard's Tower...). Exiting Treehouse makes exception to the rule: the track playing before the entering plays.
In Pelican Town, music triggering works as follows:
If the seasonal track is playing, it continues playing when entering town.
If no track is playing and the player enters Town from the Bus Stop, the Forest or the Mountain, the seasonal track will be triggered if it is before 12 PM. Otherwise, the Town theme will be triggered (given other weather, season and time conditions are met).
If the player enters Town from the Beach, the Sewers, or by exiting the Blacksmith, the Community Center, Harvey's Clinic, JojaMart, the Movie Theater or the Museum, the Town theme will be triggered (given the weather, season and time conditions are met). It will also be triggered when exiting any town building if no music was previously playing.
The Town theme auto-loops while staying in town or one of its buildings (even after 6 PM, but the track will then abruptly stop at 7 PM if outside and at 8 PM if in a building).
The track will not change, nor will be silenced, entering the following locations:
Any interior on the Farm (buildings and the cave), Mines entrance, Tent and most Town houses (1 River Road, 1 Willow Lane, 2 Willow Lane, Mayor's Manor, Pierre's General Store, Stardrop Saloon before 5 PM, Trailer)
Marnie's Ranch and Carpenter's Shop. In those, Country Shop triggers on entering only if no music was previously playing.
Community Center on entering, but the Town theme will play after exiting.
The Volcano Dungeon entrance, if the previous track is one of the three volcano tracks.
In The Mines and the Skull Cavern, music triggering is dependent of mine level and time since music last played. On floor 2, music will always begin playing. On floors 1, 11, 40, 80, and 120, the game music will stop playing. On floors 31-39, 79, 111-119, and floors that are divisible by 5, the game music will continue playing but no new tracks will be played. On all remaining floors, there is a 50% chance to play a new song if it has been at least 2.5 minutes since the last song in the Mines began. Taking the elevator to a different section of the Mines will also cause the game music to stop playing.[8]
