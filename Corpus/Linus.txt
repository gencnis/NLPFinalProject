Relationships
Linus generally considers himself an outcast of the town. He does not trust people and doesn't seem to consider anyone in town his friend due to the fact that most people don't treat him well. However, based on dialogue found in data files, Linus is friends with the Wizard, who is seen standing next to Linus during the Spirit's Eve Festival. 
This exception may be because Linus does not consider the Wizard to be part of the townsfolk.
During Festivals, he can usually be found alone and out of the way. 
At one point, Linus tells the player that his tent has been destroyed before. 
Robin mentions that she doesn't mind him living behind their house as long as he doesn't bother them. 
In Winter, Penny asks the player if they know Linus, and expresses sympathy for the fact that "everyone ignores him". Emily also expresses sympathy for Linus on Tuesdays in Summer, saying "I wish everyone could learn to be accepting of others."

Special 



Day after the glimmering boulder is removed

Quests
"Blackberry Basket": Linus will send you a letter on the 8th of Fall saying he lost his blackberry basket.  The reward for returning it to him is 1 Friendship heart. (250 Friendship points)
Linus may randomly request an item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store.  The reward is 3x the item's base value, and 150 Friendship points.
"Community Cleanup": On the Special Orders board in front of the Mayor's Manor, Linus may randomly request that the player collect 20 trash items and place them in the bin at the Train platform. The reward is 500g, 250 Friendship points, and the Fiber Seeds recipe.
Trivia
Occasionally if you speak to Linus, he will mention he has ventured down deep into the mines.
You can toggle the Campfire in front of Linus' tent.  This seems to have no effect on the game whatsoever (no special dialogues, no effect on friendship, etc.)  Linus will never re-light the fire if you put it out, so you can put it out or rekindle it whenever you like.
Linus is one of the villagers who may find the player if they pass out at 2am.
Linus mentions that somebody was throwing rocks at his tent. This suggests that not everyone in the town is supportive of his lifestyle.
If he catches the player rummaging in the trash, Linus's heart points increase by +5 (instead of decreasing by -25 like every other villager).
If Linus sends the player a Catfish as a gift in the mail, he will say the mountain lake has been kind to him. However, Catfish cannot be caught in the mountain lake.
