“

“I don't know if I'll ever get used to being back home. The peacefulness of the town feels like a mask. That's probably just me though.”

Details 


When the player enters Jodi and Kent's house, a cutscene begins and player walks into the kitchen and Jodi says, "Hi, (Player)! I'm just making some popcorn." Kent screams and runs into the kitchen exclaiming "That sound... You should've known that sound would remind me of the war!" Jodi stops the popcorn, and Kent goes on to lament the loss of his friends. Jodi says, "But, dear... popcorn was always your favorite before you left." Kent responds with, "...Things have changed." Jodi then quietly asks the player's character if they can say something to Kent. There are three choices:
Jodi's to blame... she should've known better (-25 friendship.) Kent gets angry and says, "You keep quiet! Stop trying to turn me against my wife." Then apologizes to Jodi.
I know you're hurting... but don't blame your wife. (+50 friendship.) Kent says the player is "absolutely right," and apologizes to Jodi.
(Lie) Blame me... I asked for popcorn. (-50 friendship.) Kent gets angry and says, "Don't lie to me! I hate lies more than anything!" Then apologizes to Jodi.

Trivia
Kent has PTSD from the time he's served in the war. This can be noted by his reaction to the popcorn sound in his Three Heart Event and his dislike of open fields in the Flower Dance. Kent can also explain in a dialogue to the player that his fatigue is due to difficulty sleeping, a symptom of PTSD.
Despite his dislike of the sound of popcorn, it is a loved concession when given to him at the Movie Theater. This is most likely because he still loves the snack, but if he were around while it's being cooked it would trigger his PTSD.
The chevrons on Kent's sleeve can be interpreted in several ways. Several countries use chevrons (whether pointed upward or downward) to indicate the rank of Corporal, including America, Australia, Brazil, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The French, Italian, Korean, and Turkish military forces use variations of gold (or red) chevrons to indicate the rank of Sergeant. In the Chinese and Japanese military forces, two chevrons below a star or other symbol indicate the rank of Private First Class. The Russian military used chevrons to indicate various ranks in various branches until 2010.
In a dialogue that occurs on Fridays, Sam reveals that Kent used to be a garbage man when they lived in Zuzu City.
In a dialogue that occurs on Mondays in Summer, Sam says that Kent took him on trips to the desert when he was younger.
Despite the fact Kent likes eggs, he tells you during the Egg Festival that he isn't a big fan of eggs.
