Qi's Secret Walnut Room for  20


Ingredients:

 Hardwood (30) Radioactive Bar (1)


The Heavy Tapper is a crafted item that works at twice the production rate of a regular Tapper. The recipe can be purchased in Mr. Qi's Secret Walnut Room on Ginger Island for  20.  It can be placed on a tree to produce Maple Syrup, Oak Resin, Pine Tar, or Sap. It can also be placed on a Mushroom Tree to produce different mushrooms, but the production rate is not increased compared to a regular Tapper.
The Heavy Tapper can be removed from a tree by hitting it once with an axe or pickaxe. This leaves the Tapper intact and able to be reused.
If the Heavy Tapper is on a tree when it is struck by lightning, both the Tapper and its contents are destroyed.
Heavy Tappers placed on Maple Trees, Oak Trees, Pine Trees, or Mahogany Trees continue to produce during Winter.  Since Mushroom Trees turn to stumps in Winter, any tappers placed on them produce nothing during that season.
