Flower Honey
Fully-grown flowers planted near the Bee House will have an effect on the type of honey produced, increasing its sale price. Flowers are not used up when a hive produces honey, and multiple hives can make honey from the same flower, so one flower can service a large number of hives. The honey type is determined when harvested, rather than when it becomes ready: If honey is left in a Bee House until a nearby flower has bloomed, it will be harvested as flower honey.
If no flowers are planted near the Bee House, or if a Bee House has produced flower honey, but the flower is harvested before the honey, the honey will become "Wild Honey," the least profitable Honey. Similarly, if a Bee House is removed with a tool while it has flower honey ready for harvesting, the honey will go into inventory as "Honey", which is functionally identical to Wild Honey. Honey purchased from the Oasis or Traveling Cart, or deconstructed from a Warp Totem: Farm, is also called "Honey", and is also functionally identical to Wild Honey.

Sell Prices
Flowers not listed below (i.e., Crocus and Sweet Pea) do not influence the price of honey.  Daffodil and Dandelion are classified as "Forage" not "Flower" in-game, so they do not influence the price of honey either.
The formula used to calculate the sale price of honey is base honey sell price + (base flower sell price × 2).[1]
