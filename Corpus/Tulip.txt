Bundles
Tulip is one of the options for the  Garden Bundle in the Pantry (Remixed).

Recipes
Tulip is not used in any recipes.

Tailoring
Tulip can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Skirt.   It can also be used as a red dye in the dye pots, located at Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
Tulip is not used in any quests.

Notes
Tulips have an equal chance of being one of five different colors.  Tulips of different colors will occupy different slots in inventory or chests.  Five colors × four quality levels = 20 possible spaces used.

Due to its relatively small profit margin, it may be better to grow Tulips for aesthetic purposes or to use as gifts than for profit.
Their cheap price, short growing period and reasonable energy restoration rate makes them surprisingly useful as early-game energy source.
History
1.4: Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.5: Iridium quality is now possible when using Deluxe Fertilizer.
