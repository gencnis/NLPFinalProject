Mining  Fishing  Duggy (25%)


Sell Price:

50g

The Geode is a Mineral deposit that contains minerals, artifacts, ores, or basic resources.  It can be obtained from breaking rocks above ground in Stardew Valley and in The Mines (especially floors 1-39), or dropped by Duggies.  It may also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests or received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star.  A Stonefish Fish Pond may produce 1 or 5 Geodes when its population reaches 9. 2-4 Geodes may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm if the player has not upgraded the Farmhouse yet.
The geode can be broken open by Clint in the Blacksmith shop for 25g or by using a Geode Crusher.

Resources
Note that obtaining Iron Ore from a Geode is only possible after reaching level 26 of The Mines.  Before reaching level 26, a geode that would give iron ore will instead give copper ore. Except for clay and stone, the following items will be obtained in the following amounts: 30% for 1, 30% for 3, 30% for 5, 9% for 10, and 1% for 20. Stone has a 50% chance to use those values and a 50% chance to give only 1. Only 1 clay can be obtained from a single geode.

Tailoring
Geode is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Gray Hoodie.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
2 Geodes may be requested by Sunfish in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 3 to 5.
5 Geodes may be requested by Stonefish in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 5 to 7.
Trivia
By multiplying the sell price of each item by the chance to obtain it and how many you would receive on average (with ores, clay and stone) and adding those products together, you can find the average profit of breaking open a single geode. Geodes have an average return of 59.94g, or 34.94g with the 25g cost of opening factored in. With the Gemologist Profession, geodes have an average return of 73.58g, or 48.58g with the 25g cost of opening factored in. However, the geode will sell in the shipping bin for 50g, giving a net loss of 2.42g with Gemologist, or a net loss of 15.06g without Gemologist. It is therefore not profitable to process geodes and sell the contents.

Users with access to their saved game files may find the "Stardew Predictor" utility helpful for predicting which items will be produced from breaking open geodes.  The utility is located at:  https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/
