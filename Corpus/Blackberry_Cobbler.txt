The Queen of Sauce


14 Fall, Year 2



Ingredients:

 Blackberry (2) Sugar (1) Wheat Flour (1)

Blackberry Cobbler is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. It can also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star.
Note: This recipe can be profitable - it will result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients without Bear's Knowledge, or if using Wheat Flour and/or Sugar from the Mill.  If the player has Bear's Knowledge and purchases Sugar and Wheat Flour from Pierre's General Store, using the lowest quality blackberry will result in the cost being equal to the sell price.
