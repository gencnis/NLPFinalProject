The Glacierfish is a fish that can be caught in Cindersap Forest during Winter.  It is one of the five Legendary Fish, so it can only be caught once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer.
The special requirements necessary to hook a Glacierfish are:[1]

Fishing level 6, either naturally or using Fishing Buffs.
The player must be standing on one specific tile: the one at the southernmost tip of Arrowhead Island. This exact location is revealed in Secrets of the Legendary Fish.
The bobber must be located in water with a Fishing Zone of at least 3, i.e., it must be at least four tiles away from any land in every direction.
The Glacierfish can appear one tile closer to land (Zone=2) if the bobber lands in Bubbles.
When all of these requirements are met, each cast has a 50% chance of hooking a Glacierfish. Unlike with other Legendary Fish, using a Curiosity Lure does not increase the chance of hooking it.
The Glacierfish can be caught regardless of season using Magic Bait.
