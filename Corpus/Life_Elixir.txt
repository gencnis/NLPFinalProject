Life Elixir is an edible crafted item.  The recipe is earned at Combat skill level 2.  Iridium Bats in the Skull Cavern may drop a Life Elixir when slain (5% chance).

Tailoring
Life Elixir can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Dark Highlight Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as a purple dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
Life Elixir is not used in any quests.

Trivia
Consuming regular quality Purple Mushroom + Morel + Chanterelle individually restores 220 energy, which is more than a Life Elixir. Consuming individual mushrooms, however, will not restore health to full.
It is not profitable to make this item for sale, as the components would sell for more (645g total).
History
1.4: Can now be used in Tailoring.
