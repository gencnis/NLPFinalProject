The Blobfish is a fish that can be caught in the submarine ride at the Night Market, which takes place at The Beach during Winter 15-17. It can also be caught by using Magic Bait in the southwest corner of the beach: From the left-most pier, in the southwestern corner, fish facing west.
In the submarine ride at the Night Market, there is a 10% chance to hook a Blobfish (20% if using a Curiosity Lure).[1] If using Magic Bait in the southwest corner of the beach, there is a 3.3% chance to hook a Blobfish (6.8% if using a Curiosity Lure).[2]
The Blobfish and the Pufferfish are the only fishing rod fishes that have a "floater" behavior in the fishing mini-game.
