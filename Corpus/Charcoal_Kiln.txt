The Charcoal Kiln is a piece of equipment used to burn Wood into Coal. Coal is used in several Crafting recipes, and to smelt different metals into their respective bars.
It takes  30m[1] (≈23 seconds real-time) to change the Wood into Coal. For every 10 Wood, you will get 1 Coal.
It can also be obtained by completing the  Construction Bundle in the Crafts Room (198 wood, 99 stone, 10 hardwood) or the  Sticky Bundle in the Crafts Room (Remixed).
