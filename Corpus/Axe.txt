The Axe is a tool used to chop branches, trees and small stumps, as well as for removing or harvesting certain objects, especially important for obtaining Wood.  An axe may also be used as a weapon to inflict a small amount of damage.  An axe is required to harvest Giant Crops.
The basic Axe is obtained at the beginning of the game. It can be upgraded at the Blacksmith.  The cost and resource requirements for each upgrade are shown in the table below.  
When upgraded, the axe can be used to chop down large stumps and eventually logs that grant Hardwood.  The Steel Axe is required to remove the Large Log that blocks the entrance to the Secret Woods.
As of v1.11 on the Riverlands and Forest Farm Maps, some bushes can be destroyed with a Copper Axe (or better).
