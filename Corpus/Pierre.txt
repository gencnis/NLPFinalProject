“

“If you're looking for seeds, my shop is the place to go. I'll also buy produce from you for a good price! A little agriculture could really inject new life into the local economy!”


— Pierre


Pierre is a villager who lives in Pelican Town. He owns and runs Pierre's General Store.

Schedule
Pierre can be found running his general store each day between 9am and 5pm (except Wednesday when the store is closed). After the Community Center has been fully restored his store will be open every day of the week.
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Pierre may randomly spend the day there. (He will leave a cash box on the counter of the store, so the player is still able to make purchases.) After leaving the Island at 6pm, Pierre will immediately go home to bed. Pierre never visits the Resort on Festival days.

In the aisles of the general store.


8:30 AM

Relationships
Pierre lives with his wife Caroline and their daughter Abigail behind his shop. On Friday evenings he socializes with other villagers at the saloon, but outside that he only interacts with others at his store.
He feels threatened by JojaMart and Morris' attempts to draw his customers away from the store, and worries that he won't be able to make as much money because of this.
He has a strained relationship with Abigail due to their different beliefs, as shown in a few cutscenes.

"Your secret is safe with me." (+70 friendship.) He responds, "Thanks, I appreciate that. Just forget you ever saw this, okay?...And I'll just forget that you were snooping around in my bedroom!"
"Your wife deserves to know about this." (-500 friendship.) He responds, "You would really do that to me? You're terrible. You shouldn't have been snooping around in my bedroom in the first place! Nosy neighbors are the worst."
Pierre says he has to find a new hiding spot.


Quotes


Regular 



First Meeting




“

“Hey, it's [Mr./Mrs.] [Player], the new farmer! I'm Pierre, owner of the local general store. If you're looking for seeds, my shop is the place to go. I'll also buy produce from you for a good price! A little agriculture could really inject new life into the local economy!”


Regular




“

“Welcome! If you're looking for seeds, you've come to the right place!”





“

“Hi, [Player]. Need any seeds or fruit tree saplings?”





“

“Sometimes I get new items in stock, so make sure to stop by every so often. It's a lot of work to run a shop.”





“

“I'm happy to buy any produce off you. I'll give you a fair price, of course!”





“

“I really do appreciate your business, [Mr./Mrs.] [Player]. I've been having a harder and harder time turning a decent profit.”





“

“Business has been slow since Joja moved into town. It's hard to compete with their selection.”





“

“Hi there. Is your farm doing well? Maybe a few of my seeds will spruce things up.”





“

“*sigh*... I've got those behind-the-counter blues... I wish I could go for a walk, but I can't leave the store unattended. I've heard the flowers are in bloom and the air smells great...”





“

“Hey, [Player]. You're my number one customer!”


Wednesdays
Although you cannot talk to Pierre on Wednesdays before the Community Center is complete, he has dialogue scripted in underlying data files.




“

“It's my day off today. Hmmm... what to do...”





“

“When I was younger I always had something interesting to do... now I find myself just wasting time whenever I'm not at work.”





“

“I'm so glad to have a day off from work.”


On a rainy day




“

“Most people stay indoors in days like this... It's not good for business.”


If sold low quality crops to Pierre




“

“Hey, remember that [item] you sold me the other day? I ended up serving it to the family for a special dinner. I can't say it was a hit... ... well,... back to business, huh?”


If sold high quality crops to Pierre




“

“Hey, remember that [item] you sold me the other day? I ended up serving it to the family for a special dinner. My wife loved it! ...And Abby even started going to town on it after I smothered the thing in hoisin sauce. ... well,... back to business, huh?”


If Player is married to Abigail




“

“Hello, er... my [son/daughter]?”





“

“Hi, [Player]. How's Abigail doing? The shop hasn't been the same without her...”


If Community Center is complete




“

“This is a dream-come-true! You can't begin to imagine how much stress JojaMart was causing me. For a small town like this, one store is enough! There's too much social pressure for me to overcharge, anyway.”


If Joja Membership is purchased




“

“This is a sad day for Pelican Town... The stronger Joja becomes, the closer I move toward bankruptcy. I might have to sell the shop soon...”


6+ Hearts




“

“You know, I used to be a pretty good boxer back in the day... my right hook was the stuff of legend!”





“

“*sigh*... No matter how well the business does, it's never enough to satisfy my desire for success. What's wrong with me? Maybe I'm just bored with domestic life. Some day I'm going to open a new shop in the city and make a killing. Unfortunately, business is so slow I can hardly save any money...”


8+ Hearts




“

“Does Abigail look anything like me? Don't tell my wife, but sometimes I wonder if I'm really the father.”





“

“Don't tell my wife, but I hate to cook dinner.”





“

“I'll tell you a secret. Sometimes, when the store is empty, I'll practice my opera singing behind the counter. Don't tell anyone.”


Summer




“

“I've got summer seeds available! You'd better stock up.”





“

“I'm so glad to have a day off from work.”





“

“Everyone's enjoying the weather instead of shopping... *sigh*”





“

“Oh, hi. Are you satisfied with the quality of my summer seeds?”





“

“Summer is a good time to eat a refreshing salad, don't you think?”





“

“Ugh... It's so hot in here.”


Fall




“

“Fall seeds are here! Crops don't grow in winter so this is your last shot until spring. Better go all out, huh?”





“

“It's starting to get cold outside... That means more people come into the shop to warm up... hehe.”





“

“My dream is to keep opening new stores until I become extremely wealthy. hehehe. Hi there. Is your farm still doing well? Maybe a few of my seeds will spruce things up.”





“

“I'm happy to buy whatever you produce on the farm. Yes, I do resell it for a profit... but that's the benefit of being an established shop owner. Don't get any ideas...”





“

“If I didn't have this shop to run I would be outside right now... The leaves look great and the mushrooms are sprouting.”


Winter




“

“You can't grow any crops during winter... so I have no seeds to offer you. It's really going to cut into our profits.”





“

“I'm going to surprise Caroline tonight with dinner and a bottle of Stardew Red. Don't tell anyone! Finally, a day of relaxation.”





“

“Hi. In the mood for a little shopping?”





“

“I mainly deal in edibles, so if you've got any ores or wood you'd better try selling them somewhere else.”





“

“Is it just me or is there a cold draft in here?”





“

“If I didn't have this shop to run I would be outside right now. It would be fun to throw a snowball.”


At Ginger Island




“

“I'm losing a lot of money being away from the shop... But, you know what? It's worth it.”





“

“Mmm... that salty smell of the sea is making me want some sashimi.”





“

“Eh, let the kids play in the sun. I'll just sit in this chair.”





“

“Drink after drink... Gus must be making a killing!”
