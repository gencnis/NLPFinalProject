Pelican Town is where the player moves to at the start of the game, located in Stardew Valley. Pelican Town is where most of the villagers live, work, and socialize.
Lewis is the mayor of Pelican Town and has been for over 20 years; he comments that he has not had competition for the role since first becoming mayor.
The northwest entrance to town connects to the Bus Stop and The Farm. The southwest passage connects to Cindersap Forest, which contains Marnie's Ranch, Leah's Cottage, and the Wizard's Tower.  Directly south of town is The Beach. North of town connects to The Mountain, with Robin's carpenter shop, the mines, the Adventurer's Guild, the Railroad, and the Quarry.
Initially, there are weeds located near 2 Willow Lane, in the area behind 1 Willow Lane, behind JojaMart, and to the west of the Community Center, below the playground.  These weeds will die during Winter, but will respawn at the start of each new year.

Villager Paths
 Villager Paths in Pelican Town
Pelican Town has many villagers walking through it, limiting the number of places where items can be safely placed.


Fishing
 Fishing Zones in Pelican Town.
River fish can be caught in the river flowing through Pelican Town. In Fall, a Legendary Fish, the Angler, can be caught at the north end of the river. Ms. Angler, one of the legendary fish II, can also be caught there.
When fishing in the fountain to the left of the Community Center, a present box containing a Decorative Trash Can (10% chance) can be found. Otherwise, a single piece of wood or stone will be caught, with equal probability (45% chance each). [5]

Trivia
Pelican Town is located within the Ferngill Republic, at war with the Gotoro Empire across the Gem Sea[6].
Dr. Harvey, in calling out on his shortwave radio, identifies his location (in Pelican Town) as 52 north, 43.5 east. Thus, if Stardew Valley is on Earth, it can be found near a village called Krasnoye (one of many such) in Russia - about 160 km (100 mi) WNW of Saratov, and about 600 km (375 mi) SE of Moscow. "Krasnoye" means "beautiful" or "red". However, it is not on a sea shore.
The player can't fill their watering can from the fountain.
