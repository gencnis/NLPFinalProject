 Ostrich Egg


The Ostrich is an animal that lives in a Barn. Ostriches can be hatched by placing an Ostrich Egg into an Ostrich Incubator, taking  15,000m (9d 10h) to incubate, or  7,500m (4d 18h 20m) with the Coopmaster Profession.
An Ostrich Egg can be initially found by solving Journal Scrap #10, or as a random drop from the chests in the Volcano Dungeon.

Produce
Main article: Animals#Produce
Ostriches who eat every day mature after 7 nights have passed. A mature and fed Ostrich produces an Ostrich Egg every 7 days. An Ostrich Egg can be placed in an Ostrich Incubator to hatch another ostrich, or sold for 600g.
An Ostrich Egg can be placed in a Mayonnaise Machine to produce 10 Mayonnaise of the same quality as the egg.
