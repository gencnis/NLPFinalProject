Pink Cake is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.  It can also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star or may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. If the player's character is male, after he earns 120,000g he will receive a letter from mom with a Pink Cake enclosed.
3 Pink Cakes are the reward for completing the  Chef's Bundle on the Bulletin Board. Pink cake is also sometimes contained within Big Slimes (0.1% chance). Killing the big slime will result in a receiving a Pink Cake, or two if the player has a Burglar's Ring equipped.
The Statue Of Endless Fortune produces one Pink Cake on Spring 10, Spring 14, and Summer 4.
