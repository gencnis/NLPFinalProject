Junimo Chest





Through the power of forest magic, every Junimo Chest links to the same stash.


Information 


Source:

Qi's Walnut Room for  Qi Gem (30)


Sell Price:

Cannot be sold


Junimo Chests are purchasable storage items that function similarly to chests, although instead of maintaining an individually managed inventory, all Junimo Chests share one global inventory among them, of nine spaces. Any item(s) placed in one Junimo Chest can be accessed by the player from any other Junimo Chest.
They can be purchased from Qi's Walnut Room. The first two chests can be bought for  30. Beginning the following day, single additional chests can be bought for  15 each.
Much like regular chests, Junimo Chests must be empty to be removed, and can be placed in many different places throughout the Stardew world. However, if a Junimo Chest is left in the walking pathway of a villager it will be destroyed. Its contents, however, will not be dropped, and will still be accessible from other Junimo Chests.

History
1.5: Introduced.
1.5.2: Special Order related items that are stashed in Junimo Chests are now properly removed once the Special Order expires.
