Behavior
Ghosts will immediately hover towards the player upon entering the level. They will ignore physical obstacles, such as rocks, and can fly over the black space in the mines which the player cannot access. After hitting the player, Ghosts will teleport to a random location, firing back from the target. Ghosts move at a slower pace than bats do.

Strategy
Stand still and swing at it with a club or a sword right before it hits you. High-damage but slow weapons are more efficient than quick, low-damage weapons such as daggers. Ghosts are knocked back several tiles after being hit, so walking towards them may speed up the process of killing them. Otherwise, wait until they slowly float back towards you for another strike.

Notes
Ectoplasm can only drop if the "A Curious Substance" quest is active.
History
1.0: Introduced.
1.5: Added a 9.5% drop chance for Ectoplasm if the "A Curious Substance" quest is active.
