The Beet is a vegetable crop that grows from Beet Seeds after 6 days.  Beet Seeds can be purchased from the Oasis.
Players have the ability to craft Sugar from Beets by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one Beet will make three sugar. Sugar will appear in the box on the right side of the mill the following morning.
