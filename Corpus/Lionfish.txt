Tailoring
Lionfish can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Sailor Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Lionfish can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 3 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing two quests. The primary output is orange Lionfish Roe, but other items are possible starting at population 4.
