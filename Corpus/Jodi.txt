“

“Maybe I've spoiled the boys a bit. They've never had to do any chores. I guess I want them to be able to enjoy their childhood while they still can.”


— Jodi


Jodi is a villager who lives in Pelican Town. She lives at 1 Willow Lane with her husband Kent (who is away serving in the military until the first of Spring Year 2) and two sons, Sam and Vincent.

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Jodi may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Jodi will immediately go home to bed. Jodi never visits the Resort on Festival days or her checkup day at Harvey's Clinic. She also won't visit the Resort on Vincent's checkup day.
Shown below are Jodi's schedules prioritized highest to lowest within each season. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

Quotes


Regular 



First Meeting




“

“Oh! You aren't exactly how I imagined... but that's okay! I'm Jodi.
It's a quiet little town, so it's very exciting when someone new moves in! Having a farmer around could really change things.”



Regular




“

“Maintaining a household is difficult work... but somebody has to do it. Yes?”





“

“Exercise is important for staying healthy. I always make sure to set aside some time for it. As a parent, I don't have much time to devote to myself. So I try and make every minute count.”





“

“I wish I could spend more time outside, but there's so much work to do.
I started wearing rubber gloves to keep my hands soft. The older you get, the more work you have to do to stay healthy. Ok, bye!”






“

“What did you say? It's [current time] already? My goodness! I still have tons of work to do!”





“

“So you're a farmer, huh? Interesting. I've never met a farmer before. Maybe some day you can teach me how to grow vegetables.”





“

“The food at JojaMart might not be the healthiest for my family, but with such low prices you'd be crazy to shop anywhere else!”





“

“Hi. Need something?”





“

“I'm so glad you're trying to improve that old farm. Once you've got everything in order, it's going to add a lot to our community! It's going to be a lot of work for you, though. Bye.”





“

“I'm taking a break from house chores today. I'm taking the day off. If I don't spend any time outside, I'll go crazy! Plus I don't want my legs to turn soft.”


Before leaving house for Vincent's doctor visit




“

“Vincent hates going to the doctor more than anything, but he'll just have to deal with it.”


In the clinic's waiting room with Vincent




“

“Be brave, Vincent. Think of your father.”


In the clinic's examination room with Vincent




“

“Doctor Harvey? I'm worried about Vincent's height. Isn't he a little short for his age?”


If Joja has closed




“

“The food at Pierre's is so much fresher and healthier than anything I ever bought at JojaMart. I do miss those cheap Joja prices, though.”


If sold high quality crops to Pierre




“

“Hi... did you sell [item] to the general store the other day? I think I bought it... It was pretty high-quality stuff. As soon as I smelled it I was back in Granny's old cottage...”


Before Kent's return




“

“My husband Kent is a soldier, working overseas. That's why he's not here right now. I know he'll come back safe once his tour is over! Need something?”





“

“Yesterday I visited Yoba's Altar to ask for my husband's safe return. I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard sometimes.”


After Kent's return




“

“Kent has been home for a while now, but he still seems uneasy.”


If Player is married to Sam




“

“How's Sam doing? I have to admit, there's less cooking and cleaning to do since he moved out...”


6+ Hearts




“

“It's nice to have a family... but I'd be lying if I said I never long for the freedom of youth...”





“

“Where does all the time go? *sigh* I remember when Sam was a little baby wearing diapers. He was such a cute little kid. Don't tell him I said that. You must really like talking to me, huh?”





“

“*sigh*... Sometimes I dream about life on my own... without a family to look after. Is that horrible? Don't tell anyone.”


8+ Hearts




“

“I had a dream that I had complete freedom, no obligation to anyone but myself...
...Then I woke up and realized I had a full day of house chores ahead of me...”






“

“We kind of rushed into our marriage, with Kent being a soldier and all... I hardly got a taste of youth and freedom, and now it's too late to ever go back. Just don't make the same mistake.”


Summer




“

“Summer is nice, but it also means more work. I'll have to keep the garden in shape on top of working in the house!”





“

“Hello. Do you need something? I'm a little busy.”





“

“Housework is frustrating because you're never finished. The day after I sweep the floor, it's dirty again.”





“

“What in the world am I going to make for dinner? *sigh*...”


Fall




“

“Maybe I've spoiled the boys a bit. They've never had to do any chores. I guess I want them to be able to enjoy their childhood while they still can. Well, Sam's basically a man now, though. I hope he hasn't grow up to be lazy. That won't do. Being a parent isn't very easy.”





“

“Caroline and I are good friends. I tell her everything.”





“

“When you become a parent, you have to leave your old lifestyle behind. Maybe that's not entirely true... but if you're not careful, it will happen.”


Winter




“

“I loved playing in the snow when I was a kid. The great thing about being a mother is that I get to enjoy it again.”





“

“Hi. Do you get tired of people asking about your farm all the time? I think I would.”





“

“What do I do for fun? Hmm... That'a a good question. I like sleeping.”





“

“Sam makes a lot of noise with that music of his. I hope it doesn't disturb the neighbors.”





“

“It would be nice to take a vacation once in a while...”





“

“If I was rich the first thing I'd do would be to hire a maid and a chef. My goodness, that would be nice!”


At Ginger Island




“

“What a treat!”





“

“The view is breathtaking! Deep blue as far as the eye can see...”





“

“We all love it when Gus shows up.”





“

“I think I'll make seafood tonight.”
