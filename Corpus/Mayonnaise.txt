 Egg (1) or Large Egg (1) or Golden Egg (1) or Ostrich Egg (1)


Mayonnaise is an Artisan Good made using the Mayonnaise Machine, taking 3 hours. 
Normal sized White and Brown eggs produce regular quality Mayonnaise. Large White and Brown eggs produce gold quality Mayonnaise. The quality of the egg is not a factor in determining the quality of the Mayonnaise.
Ostrich Eggs produce 10 jars of Mayonnaise at once. Unlike chicken eggs, Ostrich Eggs produce Mayonnaise in the same quality as the egg. This is the only way to obtain a silver quality or iridium quality Mayonnaise.
Golden Eggs produce 3 jars of Mayonnaise at gold quality at once, regardless of the quality of the eggs used.
