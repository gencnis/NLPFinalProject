Quests



Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

"Knee Therapy": George will send you a letter on the 25th of Summer requesting a Hot Pepper.  The reward is 200g and 1 Friendship heart.
George may randomly request an item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store.  The reward is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
George is to be gifted the Advanced TV Remote in The Pirate's Wife quest.
Notes
Ironically, George may randomly request Quartz at the "Help Wanted" board for his aching back, even though he hates Quartz as a gift.
George will send you recipes for Fried Eel and Spicy Eel, which are ironically two of his wife's hated gifts.
According to Evelyn she and George met in a snowball fight during the Festival of Ice, in the same dialogue she also states that George used to be "a gentleman" back in the day.
George recounts that he was a coal miner "back in the day", which can be approximated to 40 years ago as that's how long he's had the Arctic Shard he found while mining.
When moving, George will make the footstep noise as if he is walking, despite being in a wheelchair.
