The Spring Onion is a foraged item found in Spring in Cindersap Forest, but only on the southeast island (i.e., north of the Sewers entrance).  Unlike other foraged items, spring onions are respawned daily: all unharvested onions are removed at the end of each day, and new onions appear. The Livin' Off The Land Television channel airs a tip about Spring Onions on day 4. Spring Onions may randomly appear in the Traveling Cart's stock for 100-1,000g.
Harvesting a Spring Onion grants the player 3 Foraging XP. Only one onion can be harvested per plant; the Gatherer profession does not apply to spring onions.
Once the player has earned 8 hearts of friendship with Jas and Vincent, Spring Onion Mastery can be obtained, which permanently increases the sell price of Spring Onions by 5×.

On rainy days a harvested Spring Onion will leave behind a tile of dry tilled soil, whereas other tilled soil will be wet.

History
1.3.27: Added Spring Onion Mastery.
