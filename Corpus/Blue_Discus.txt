Blue Discus can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Sailor Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Blue Discus can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 3 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing two quests. The primary output is blue Blue Discus Roe, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 4.
