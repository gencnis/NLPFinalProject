“

“Alex loves sports and hanging out at the beach. He is quite arrogant and brags to everyone that he is going to be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his sports dream to fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen youth trying to 'look cool?'”


— Dev Update #12


Alex is a villager who lives in the house southeast of Pierre's General Store. Alex is one of the twelve characters available to marry.

Schedule
During Spring, Alex exits his home at 8am unless it is raining. He stands by the tree to the right of his house, playing with his gridball, and he moves towards the left of the fenced-in area in the afternoon.
During Summer, he can be found on the beach in the morning and running the Ice Cream Stand to the left of the museum in the afternoon. On the 16th of Summer, he has an appointment at the clinic.
During Winter, he works out at the Spa almost every day.  When he is not there, he will be at his house.
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Alex may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Alex will immediately go home to bed. Alex never visits the Resort on Festival days or his checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.
Shown below are Alex's schedules prioritized highest to lowest.  For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

Heart Events
Two Hearts

On a sunny summer day, visit the beach when Alex is there.



Details 


You see Alex with his gridball. He greets you and tries to toss you the gridball. You fail to catch it. He laughs and says it was a nice try. He goes on to tell you he's sure that he's going to become the first professional gridball player from Stardew Valley. He asks you what you think his chances are.
"I believe in you!" (No effect on friendship.) Alex thanks you for your support and says that he'll remember it.
"Wow, you're really arrogant." (No effect on friendship.) Alex says you're just a little jealous and leaves.

Four Hearts

Enter town between 9am and 4pm.



Details 


Alex is next to the dog pen near his home. He's talking to the dog, whose name is revealed as Dusty. He comments that both he and the dog have been through a lot and that he feels misunderstood. You come out from behind the Saloon, and Alex asks if you heard any of that.
"Yes, I heard everything." (No effect on friendship.)
"Not really... why?" (No effect on friendship.)
Either way, he says the reason that he lives with his grandparents is because of his dad. His dad was an alcoholic and would verbally abuse Alex, calling him "worthless". One day, his dad left, and shortly after that, his mother got sick and passed away. Alex goes on to say that he shouldn't dwell on it and doesn't need sympathy. Trying to lighten the mood, Alex offers you the opportunity to see what Dusty will do for a barbecued steak.


Five Hearts

Enter Alex's house when he's there.



Details 


You approach him while he stares at his bookcase and laments the fact that he hasn't read a single book in it. He tells you that he's worried he won't get anywhere in life without being knowledgeable and that he feels worthless.
"That's crazy. You're a genius!" (No effect on friendship.)
"We all have our strengths and weaknesses." (+50 friendship.)
"Worthless? Yeah, that about sums it up." (-50 friendship.)
He decides that if he works hard, he can accomplish anything. He suggests that you and he can have dinner and discuss philosophy.


Six Hearts

Enter Alex's house when he's there.



Details 


Alex expresses doubt about being able to go pro as a gridball player. He apologizes to you for acting rude and arrogant and appreciates how you stuck with him despite all that. You provide some encouragement (no choices necessary), and Alex will return to his strength workout with renewed vigor.
As of 1.3, if you enter the house right after Alex, he will not have had enough time to walk to his room and open the door, so you will get stuck there during the cutscene. However, you can still press "Skip" to resolve this.


Eight Hearts

On a sunny day, visit the beach when Alex is there. He is only scheduled to go to the beach in summer, but may pass by on the way to the Ginger Island resort in any season after it is completed.



Details 


Alex is sitting on the beach crying. You approach him and sit down next to him. He says today is the day that his mother died 12 years ago. He regrets not being able to thank her for taking care of him when he was a kid. The only keepsake he has left is his mother's music box. Alex opens it and plays it for the both of you. As the music plays, you see a vision of Alex's mother happily cradling baby Alex in her arms. As the music fades, he asks what you're thinking.
"Honor your mother's memory by always doing your best." (No effect on friendship.) Alex agrees and says that's why he's working so hard to be a professional gridball player.
"You shouldn't dwell in the past." (No effect on friendship.)
"I'll always be here for you if you get lonely." (No effect on friendship.) Alex thanks you and bashfully says you're his best friend in the whole town. If male, he says "You... you're different than other guys. More sensitive. I'm glad."
"Get over it. Life is hard for everyone." (No effect on friendship.)
After calming down, he says the two of you should head back to town. Before you leave, he nervously asks you not to tell anybody that he was crying. You laugh and walk off while he hurriedly chases after you.


Ten Hearts

Alex will send you a letter to meet him at the Saloon after dark. After receiving the letter, enter the Saloon between 7pm and 10pm.



Details 


Alex reserves a private room for your dinner date. Gus plays the violin for you two, and Emily will bring in your food.
If the player is female, Alex confesses that he has had a crush on you since the two of you first met, and although his crushes in the past faded away quickly, his feelings for you kept growing. If the player is male, Alex confesses that he has been drawn to you since the two of you first met; although he denied these feelings at first, he's now decided to follow his heart.

"I feel the same way." (No effect on friendship.) Alex is elated that the both of you were finally able to admit your feelings to each other. He happily digs into his steak. Dusty suddenly bursts through the window, salivating at the smell of food. Alex laughs.
"I'm sorry... I don't feel that way about you." (No effect on friendship.) Alex is crushed and apologizes for making you uncomfortable. He loses his appetite.

Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelors, raised friendship with each bachelor to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelor's 10-heart event, then entering The Stardrop Saloon will trigger a cutscene. If Alex is the final bachelor you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a friendly game of pool.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelors will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelors will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelors will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Exit the Farmhouse in year 2+ between 6am and 8:20am on any day other than Sunday.  You must have 5,000g available.



Details 


Alex will stop you and ask for 5,000g for a 'secret project'. If you accept, he will remark that it will be ready to be seen on Sunday.
Part 2 can be triggered by entering saloon. Alex, Kent, Shane, George, and Gus can be seen watching a gridball game in the backroom , half of which has been decorated with gridball memorabilia and a TV. The other half still has barrels, and storage.The player walks in, and Alex tells the player that although his dream of going pro may not have been realised (though he assures the farmer that he's happy with his life now), this is a small way of realising it. Kent adds that it takes his mind off things, and Shane agrees. Gus tells the player that watching the game is good for business, too. The cutscene ends with the player saying that the guys have a new tradition now and that the 5,000g was well spent.



Marriage
Main article: Marriage
Once married, Alex will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also setup a workout space behind the farmhouse where he'll sometimes go to lift weights.
On rainy nights, Alex may offer you dinner:  Survival Burger, Dish O' The Sea, Fried Eel, Crispy Bass, or Baked Fish.  On days when he stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may make you breakfast:  Omelet, Hashbrowns, or Pancakes.

Questions
Wednesday

Male players:
"I'd ask you to throw the ball around, but you don't really seem like the sports type."

Female players:
“If you weren’t a girl I’d ask you to play catch.”

I'm fine just watching you from a distance. (No effect on friendship.)
Alex responds: "Yeah, some people just aren't made for sports."

I want to play catch with you! (+15 friendship.)
Alex responds: "Really? I guess I underestimated you. My arm's a little sore, but maybe next time."

(angry) What's that supposed to mean? (No effect on friendship.)
Alex responds: "Uh...Nevermind."

Summer, Wednesday

Male players:
"Hey farm guy, I've got a question for you. Do you think I'll ever turn pro?"

Female players:
"Hey farm girl, I've got a question for you. Do you think I'll ever turn pro?"

You're destined to be a sports legend (+30 friendship.)
Alex responds: "Hey, Now that's what I'm talking about!"

Maybe if you practice a lot (No effect on friendship.)
Alex responds: "Yeah, well I'm so good I'm not going to have to practice all that much."

No, you'll most likely fail and become a salesman (-30 friendship.)
Alex responds: "That's insane. You're just jealous that I'm talented and popular and you're not. Get away from me."

Alex responds: "Yeah, I know. That's why I have it like this."

Quests
Alex may randomly request an item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store.  The reward is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
Portraits






























































Timeline
Alex's look evolved over the years the game was in development.  Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Alex's style changed over the years before the game was launched.


Trivia
At one point before the game was released, Alex was named "Josh".
In the picture of Alex holding a gridball, only four fingers are drawn on his hand. All other characters in Stardew Valley with visible hands (excluding Clint) are drawn with five fingers.
It is possible to trigger Alex's eight-heart in any season after repairing Willy's Boat if you follow him on his way to Ginger Island.
On days when he stays inside the farmhouse all day, and he offers you breakfast, two out of three of the possible breakfasts are an ingredient in one of his loved gifts, Complete Breakfast. This is an easy way to quickly increase friendship with him once married.
History
1.0: Introduced.
1.1: Added workout area behind farmhouse if married.
1.3.27: Added group 10-heart event.
