 Krobus


The Sewers are a location unlocked by obtaining the Rusty Key after donating 60 items (artifacts or minerals) to the Museum. The Sewers can be entered either through the sewer cover in the south of Pelican Town or through the grates in the south of Cindersap Forest. Krobus is located here and sells rare items.
In late-game Krobus can open a passage through the sewers to the Mutant Bug Lair, once players are on the quest Dark Talisman.

Krobus's Shop
Main article: Krobus
Krobus always sells the Sign Of The Vessel statue, the Monster Fireplace, Void Essence, Solar Essence, and Void Eggs, as well as one Stardrop, one Crystal Floor Recipe, and one Wicked Statue Recipe. In addition, he will also sell a specific quantity of one other item every day.

Statue Of Uncertainty
The Statue Of Uncertainty allows the player to change professions.  After donating 10,000g, the statue requires the player to choose one skill to change.  That night after the player goes to bed, the Level 5 "Choose a profession" screen will appear, followed by the corresponding Level 10 "Choose a profession" screen for the skill selected at the statue.
Only skills for which professions have already been chosen will appear in the Statue's menu.  As soon as the player chooses a profession to change, the bonuses for existing professions disappear. Skills that gives bonuses to sell prices will not apply to items placed in the shipping bin the day the profession is changed.
Just like levelling up a skill at the end of the day causes the player to wake up with full energy the next day no matter what, using this statue on any given day will cause the player to wake up with full energy the next day as well.


Mutant Bug Lair
Main article: Mutant Bug Lair
In late game players will get the quest Dark Talisman, which sends them to speak with Krobus in the sewers. Once spoken to he'll open a passage inside the sewers to a new small area, the Mutant Bug Lair. Inside players can gather the talisman for their quest, catch unique fish (Slimejack) and fight swarms of bugs.

Fishing

The Sewers are where the Mutant Carp, one of the five legendary fish in the game, can be caught. It is also where the Radioactive Carp, one of the five legendary fish II, can be caught. Carp, Green Algae, White Algae, and Trash are the only other items that can be caught.
