“

“Penny lives with her mom, Pam, in a little trailer by the river. While Pam is out carousing at the saloon, Penny quietly tends to her chores in the dim, stuffy room she is forced to call home. She is shy and modest, without any grand ambitions for life other than settling in and starting a family. She likes to cook (although her skills are questionable) and read books from the local library.”


— Dev Update #12


Penny is a villager who lives in Pelican Town. She's one of the twelve characters available to marry. Her trailer is just east of the center of town, west of the river. She tutors  Vincent and Jas at the library.

Schedule
Penny can usually be found in town reading or cleaning up at the trailer. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday she tutors Jas and Vincent at the museum, walking them both home afterwards. She doesn't tutor in the Summer season. Many Saturdays in Spring and Fall she'll take them to the town playground.
When it's raining Penny can either be found inside her trailer or visiting the museum looking at the selection of books.
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Penny may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Penny will immediately go home to bed. Penny never visits the Resort on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Festival days, or her checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.

She also teaches the local children, Jas, Vincent and when he moves to the mainland also Leo, at the museum a few days a week and accompanies them to the playground once in a while.
During the eight-heart cutscene, Vincent remarks that he once saw Sam and Penny climbing trees, at which Penny becomes visibly startled and scolds Vincent for gossiping. ConcernedApe has explained that he "wasn't trying to imply anything serious" with the scene regarding a continuation of Penny's interest in Sam. "[A]t 8 hearts...she's not actually interested in Sam anymore."[1]

Details 


George looks into his mailbox and wonders how he'll reach a letter in the back. Penny notices and gets the letter out for him. George is upset at being seen helpless and scolds her. Penny sees you and asks if you were watching them.
"I was. You did a kind thing there, Penny." (+50 friendship.) Penny thanks you, but is unhappy that George was upset.
"I was. You should've asked instead of assuming George wanted help." (-50 friendship.) Penny apologises to George.
"I'm just taking a walk, minding my own business." (No effect on friendship.) Penny responds "I see".
Regardless of your choice, George sighs and apologises to Penny for getting angry. He says it was very kind of her to help. Penny says she understands. After George leaves, Penny says it must be difficult growing old.

"I'd rather not think about it." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "I guess you're right... why stress out about something you can't change?"
"It's just a different part of life." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "You're right, we shouldn't ignore the reality of aging. I guess the sooner we come to terms with our mortality, the more time we can spend really living in the here-and-now."
"That's why we should respect our elders." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "That's nice of you to say... I totally agree with you. We should treat our elders with the same respect we hope to receive ourselves some day."
"I'd rather die young..." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "That's a horrible thing to say. Life is a precious thing to waste like that!"
Penny bids you farewell and leaves.


Four Hearts

Enter the trailer when she's home.



Details 


Penny complains about how messy the place is, and asks if you could help her clean up. As you do so, Pam returns home and yells at Penny for letting someone else clean her home. Pam eventually asks you to leave, and they continue their discussion privately. Pam admits that she's embarrassed to have strangers clean up the house. The next day, you get a letter of apology from Penny.

Six Hearts

Enter the trailer when she's home.



Details 


Penny asks you to try a recipe she invented.
"(Lie) Mmm! That was delicious!" (+50 friendship.) She responds: "You really mean it? Thank you! ... it's such a relief to hear that. I've been working so hard on this recipe, and I'm really proud of it. Hey, since you're the first person to try it, I'm going to name this one 'Chili de <your name>'."
"Uh... can I get the rest to go?" (-50 friendship.) Penny is crestfallen and says her recipe was a failure.
"Well it's definitely unique... how did you get it so rubbery?" (No effect on friendship.) Penny is crestfallen and says her recipe was a failure.
Regardless of your choice, she invites you to watch a movie together and your energy is increased by 165.


Eight Hearts

Enter Cindersap Forest between 9am and 4pm.



Details 


Penny is on a field trip with Jas and Vincent. Penny asks you if you'd like to be a guest speaker and share your experience about the countryside with the children.
"I'd love to!" (+10 friendship.) She responds, "Great! Let me just call the children over."
"Sure." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "Great! Let me just call the children over."
"No... I can't stand kids." (-1500 friendship.) She responds, "Really?... Uh... Well, alright. I guess I'll see you later then." The cutscene ends.
If you agree to speak to the kids, you're prompted for a number of dialogue options (which have no effect on friendship). Afterwards Penny tells the children to run along and asks you if you'd like to be a parent.

"I haven't really thought about it." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "Oh no? Well, I guess that makes sense... you're busy with other things right now."
"Absolutely. I want a big family." (+20 friendship.) She responds, "... Me too. I'm glad you feel that way."
"I guess so. It's a natural urge." (+20 friendship.) She responds, "Yes... the urge to care for something innocent and helpless. It makes sense that we'd feel that."
"No, I don't think I'd be good at it." (+10 friendship.) She responds, "Oh, really? I think you'd make a good parent."
"No, The world's crowded enough already." (-10 friendship.) She responds, "hmm... If everyone thought like that, humans would die out."
"No, I don't want to be tied down with a family." (-10 friendship.) She responds, "Oh... That's kind of sad... but I guess I can understand your point."
The scene fades and she thanks you for showing up.


Ten Hearts

You receive a letter from Penny. After receiving the letter, enter the pool area of the spa between 7pm and midnight.



Details 


Penny joins you in the pool. She asks if you know why she invited you here.
"You have something to tell me." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "That's right..."
"I'm not exactly sure." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "Really? I thought you'd have noticed by now..."
"You wanted to see me in my bathing suit." (No effect on friendship.) She responds, "No!"
Penny confesses her feelings for you.

"I feel the same way about you." (No effect on friendship.)
If the player is male, she responds, "...Oh, <your name>. I thought you did, but I wasn't sure. ...I'll always remember this night." You kiss and the cutscene ends.
If the player is female, she responds, "...Oh, <your name>. I thought you did, but I wasn't sure. You look so beautiful tonight... I... *gasp*" You kiss and the cutscene ends.
"Sorry, but I don't like you in that way..." (-1500 friendship.) She bursts into tears and the cutscene ends.

Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelorettes, raised friendship with each bachelorette to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelorette's 10-heart event, then entering Haley/Emily's House will trigger a cutscene. If Haley is the final bachelorette you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a gossip session about Mayor Lewis and Marnie's relationship.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelorettes will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelorettes will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelorettes will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Enter the farm house between 3pm and 7pm when she's home.



Details 


Penny says "Welcome home, honey... How was your day?"
It was fine (No effect on friendship.) Penny responds "Just business as usual, huh? Well, I've got a zesty new recipe in the oven, so maybe things will get a little more exciting!
Not good... (No effect on friendship.) Penny responds "Oh, I'm sorry! Well, you're back now... I'll do my best to make you feel better."
It was fantastic! (No effect on friendship.) Penny responds "That's great! I'm glad you enjoy your work so much."
Penny then says she would like to redecorate the bedroom with her hand-made decor.  She asks what style you prefer.

Forest And Moon: Peaceful Blue (No effect on friendship.)
Strawberry Home (No effect on friendship.)
Pirate Theme (No effect on friendship.)
Penny says she won't touch any of your chests, but asks you to move them out of the room.

I don't want any changes! (No effect on friendship.) Penny says she won't worry about it, then.
Part 2: If you choose to let Penny redecorate, 3 days later when waking up in the morning, the bedroom will be redecorated with the chosen style. Note that the type, number, and placement of items may vary slightly with Farmhouse upgrades.

“Hi [Player]. Your farmhouse must be pretty easy to clean, huh?”

It must be so cold to live in a tent this time of year.”

“I'm looking forward to seeing what your farm looks like in the spring. It's going to be so fresh and beautiful.”





“

“I try to stay indoors as much as possible during the winter. I hate being cold.”





“

“

“On the 25th we'll be having the Feast of the Winter Star. It's one of my favorite events. It's supposed to be a time to show gratitude for all the good things in your life... but for most people it's just a time to relax and exchange gifts.”

“

“Did you know that my mother hates '[name of random hated item]'? She finds it absolutely awful. I'm not sure why.”





“

“If you want my mother to dislike you, give her '[name of random hated item]'. She hates it with a passion. I think she might be allergic.”

“

“Hi there, honey. Ready to spend a quiet evening at home?”


Rainy Days

Right. It's best to be positive! (+50 friendship.)
"That's how I feel. I'm just going to focus on making the future better."
I think it's good to be realistic. (+10 friendship.)
"Maybe you're right. It's better to cope with reality."
Quests
Penny may randomly request an item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store.  The reward is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
Portraits








































































Timeline
Penny's look evolved over the years the game was in development.
Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Penny's style changed over the years before the game was launched.


Trivia
At one point before the game was released, Penny was named "Dana".
The dialogue choices for the player in Penny's 8-Heart and 10-Heart Events have the most punitive possible effect on friendship in the game, with each event having an option that will decrease friendship with her by 1500 points (equivalent to six hearts).
It was once impossible to obtain any of Penny's loved gifts with iridium quality. Iridium quality sandfish were added in version 1.4, and iridium quality melons and poppies were added in version 1.5.
The dish Penny cooks during her six heart event can be seen briefly when you eat it. It appears to be a Vegetable Medley, sharing the same sprite and restoring the same amount of energy as one.
Penny's 14-heart event can occur one time only. It will not reoccur if the player divorces her, erases her memories, and then re-marries her. The decorations not chosen by the player during the 14-heart event cannot be obtained.
Bugs
If Penny's 10-heart event is seen before her other heart events, occasionally the bachelorette Group Ten-Heart Event will not trigger when entering Haley & Emily's house.
Penny's marriage schedule overrides any deviations. This means Penny will still walk home the children even if it is raining, even though the children are not there.
