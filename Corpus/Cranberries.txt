Number of Harvests
Most fertilizers have limited effect on multiple-harvest crops, including Cranberries. Basic and Quality Fertilizers affect only the first berry from each harvest, and Speed-Gro fertilizers do not decrease the time between harvests. As shown in the comparison above, while Deluxe Speed-Gro (≈0.25%) will drop the initial growth time from 7 to 5.25 days, the amount of yields per season after that point is still 4. Retaining soil may potentially be useful to reduce watering.

Tailoring
Cranberries can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Farmer Pants.   It can be also used as a red dye color at the dye pots in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
Cranberries are not used in any quests.

Tips
The second day appearance can be deceiving as it looks almost identical to the dead crop sprite, without the brown color.
Selling Cranberry Seeds made from the Seed Maker can be more profitable than selling the cranberries directly, and also potentially generates Ancient Seeds. Cranberry wine and jelly are more profitable, but the Seed Maker only takes 20 in-game minutes.
References

↑ The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.1, then another Cranberry will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.1, at which point the chance for an extra Cranberry ends. This, on average, will give 0.11 extra Cranberries. Keep in mind that Luck can also double the amount of extra Cranberries spawned by the above formula.


History
1.0: Introduced.
1.1: Reduced value to 75g, down from 130g
1.4: Fixed bug that caused multi-harvest plants to sometimes survive into Winter 1.  Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.5: Iridium quality is now possible when using Deluxe Fertilizer.
