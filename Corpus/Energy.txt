A slightly depleted energy bar
A player requires Energy to use tools, with the exception of scythes, weapons, and the Copper Pan. Picking up or moving a chest with your empty hands also requires energy. Currently available energy is indicated on the player's energy bar, which reflects the decreases as a day progresses.
Energy can be replenished up to its maximum by eating positive-energy food. Consuming negative-energy foods such as Sap or Void Mayonnaise reduces energy. To consume food, put it on the hotbar (the top row of inventory) and press action (right-click) with it. A notification in the bottom left of the screen will display energy and health gained by eating food. Typically, more expensive food provides more energy than cheaper food items.
Standing in the Spa also restores energy at 10 points per second[1]. In a Multiplayer game, players may slowly restore energy by standing in bed at 2 points per second[2]. (If the "Go to bed" dialogue pops up, answer "No", and remain in place.)

Exhaustion

Exhaustion indicator
The player becomes exhausted upon reaching 0 energy, indicated by an X dialog bubble above the player's head and the notice "You feel sluggish from over-exertion." The player's movement speed is significantly reduced, and Fishing Poles can no longer be cast. Other energy-consuming tools can be used, but the player's energy level becomes negative. At -15 energy, the player passes out, ending the day. If the player passes out anywhere outside the house, the player will lose 10% of their money, up to 1,000g.
Increasing energy back above zero (e.g., by eating food) will restore player movement and allow Fishing Poles to be cast again, but the player remains exhausted for the remainder of the day. There is no in-game indicator of this lingering exhaustion, but it results in a 50% reduction in that night's energy restoration.  This after-effect can be avoided by curing exhaustion, either by consuming Muscle Remedy, or (if married) kissing the player's spouse for the first time in the day.[3]
A few warning signs exist to notify the player before imminent exhaustion.  If energy is less than 20, any energy-consuming activity makes the energy bar shake and emit beads of sweat.  When energy first falls below 15, a notice appears stating "You're starting to feel exhausted."  These are warnings, not indicators of true exhaustion, and have no effect on player activities or overnight energy restoration.

Sleeping
Sleeping restores the player's initial energy level for the next day. Going to bed at or before 12:00AM normally restores energy to its maximum. However, if the player goes to bed late, passes out, or is exhausted, the amount of energy regained is reduced.
If the player goes to sleep exhausted, sleep removes the exhaustion, but energy restoration is reduced by 50%.
Energy restoration is also reduced if the player goes to bed after 12:00AM. This reduction stacks additively with the exhausted penalty.
The amount of energy reduction has been calculated in the below table.[4]

If the new day's calculated initial energy level is lower than the player's actual energy level at the time they went to sleep, the player's energy level is left unchanged and not reduced, unless they are exhausted.
A player cannot start a day with less than 1 energy.

Leveling Up
The morning after a skill is leveled up (or after changing professions at the Statue Of Uncertainty), the player awakens with full energy, regardless of the sleep or exhaustion calculation.

Restoration
Besides sleeping, certain actions can be taken to restore energy. These include: using the Spa, being in a Bed while playing Multiplayer, and eating certain edible items.

While relaxing in the spa or swimming, the player's energy and health by 1 every 100ms until they're at max, if they have not moved recently.[5]
While playing multiplayer, being in a bed will increase the player's energy and health by 1 every 500ms until at their max.[6]
Maximum Energy
The player starts the game with 270 maximum energy. Eating a Stardrop permanently increases maximum energy by 34 points. Eating every Stardrop available in the game permanently increases maximum energy to 508.
Temporary increases in maximum energy are also possible.  Up to two Max Energy buffs can be simultaneously active: one from a drink (namely, Green Tea) and one from a food.  The largest possible temporary value of maximum energy is therefore 588.
