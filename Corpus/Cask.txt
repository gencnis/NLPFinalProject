The Cask is a type of Artisan Equipment used to age Artisan Goods. It takes Beer, Cheese, Goat Cheese, Mead, Pale Ale, and Wine, and ages them to increase their quality and value.
Normal, silver, and gold quality items can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an Axe, Hoe, or Pickaxe.
Casks are able to produce items with "iridium star" quality. Iridium star is the highest level of quality, which doubles the value of an item. Different types of items take longer or slower to age. Wine takes the longest, at 2 seasons of aging to go from basic wine to iridium quality wine.
Casks can be placed anywhere, however they will only accept goods to refine if they are actually in the cellar.

Placement Strategy
The cellar comes with 33 casks.  It is possible to fill the cellar with 125 casks (on PC) and still leave paths to reach all of them without displacing any of them.
It's also possible to completely fill the cellar with Casks.  This requires 189 casks, made of 156 Hardwood and 3120 Wood. In order to use all 189 casks, the player must fill the casks all at once, placing additional casks while moving towards the exit. In order to harvest the finished product the player must reverse the process, removing empty casks while carving a path to the furthest ones. This can be time-consuming, so it may be a desirable option for only the most valuable products (e.g., Starfruit or Ancient Fruit wine).
On mobile devices, casks in corners cannot be reached, so 118 is the maximum reachable number of casks.  With a controller, it's possible that casks in diagonal corners may not be reachable.
PC and mobile layouts described here are shown in the Gallery below.

With the exception of the two highest-value wines, cheeses give the best value compared to the processing time required to age them to iridium quality. The best value wines are included in the table below along with all unique cask products.

Followed by all other wines in descending order of fruit/wine price.

Note that although the large milks make gold quality cheeses directly, the final aging step is both 50% of the total value increase and 50% of the required time, so the g/day remains the same. The prices above assume no relevant skills. Choosing Artisan raises the base prices of all cask-aged products by the same percentage, so while the overall values will increase, the relative order of g/day stays the same. Choosing Rancher, however, will only increase the price of the cheeses, raising Cheese to ~19.7 g/day and Goat Cheese to ~34.3 g/day, making it better than Ancient Fruit Wine in this case.
