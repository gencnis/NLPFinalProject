Tailoring
Salmon is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Faded Denim Shirt.   It can also be used as a red dye in the dye pots, located in Haley's and Emily's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Salmon can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The only possible output is light red Salmon Roe.
