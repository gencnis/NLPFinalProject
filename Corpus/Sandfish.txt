Tailoring
Sandfish can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Fish Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Sandfish can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing two quests. The primary output is yellow Sandfish Roe, but Cactus Seeds are also possible at population 10.
