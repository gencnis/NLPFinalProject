The Return Scepter is a non-consumable Warp Totem. It warps the player directly outside of their Farmhouse.
It's purchasable from Krobus in The Sewers for 2,000,000g, making it the most expensive inventory item in the game and second most expensive item, only behind the Gold Clock. It functions similarly to Warp Totem: Farm, but is not consumed when used and teleports the player to the Farmhouse door instead of the totem warp point.

Destination
The player will be teleported to the door outside the Farmhouse.
