The Qi Bean is a seed found throughout Stardew Valley and on Ginger Island during the quest Qi's Crop.
While the quest is active, Qi Beans can be found by breaking rocks, chopping down trees and stumps, from Garbage Cans, killing monsters, breaking geodes, Artifact Troves, or Golden Coconuts, digging Artifact Spots, shaking Palm Trees on Ginger Island, opening chests and breaking crates in the Volcano Dungeon, and fishing. They can also be made by placing a Qi Fruit in a Seed Maker.
All Qi Fruit and Qi Beans despawn when the quest is over (i.e., the day after the player ships them or the quest timer ends), including growing crops, all players' inventories, chests, Preserves Jars, Kegs, and Marlon's item recovery service list.

Dyeing
Qi Bean can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Tips
Given that Fishing Treasure Chests have a 48% chance to yield a stack of up to 4 Qi Beans during the quest, fishing is a reliable source of Qi Beans when combined with the Magnet bait, Pirate Profession, and a Treasure Hunter tackle.
Putting Qi Fruit into Seed Makers and planting the resulting Qi Beans will, on average, nearly double the Qi Fruit supply. Qi Fruit produced early in the quest can be doubled several times with this method.
Breaking any type of Geode may occasionally yield 1 or 5 Qi Beans.
The use of Speed-Gro, Deluxe Speed-Gro, or Hyper Speed-Gro, and the Agriculturist Profession can reduce the time between harvests by 1 or 2 days.
History
1.5: Introduced.
1.5.2: Can now be grown on the farm during winter.
1.5.3: Qi Beans are now properly removed from any machines/craftables and from Marlon's item recovery service after the Qi Challenge expires.
