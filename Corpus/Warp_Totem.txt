Warp Totems are items that can be used as instant transport to different areas on the map. They can be crafted, earned, or purchased at the Casino, and are used to quickly travel to different parts of the Valley. Crafting recipes come from leveling up Foraging skill or purchasing at various vendors. To use a Warp Totem, select it in inventory and "use" it (right-click).
Later in the game there are permanent teleporters available which replace consumable Warp Totems. They function much the same way, but are not consumed on use.
There are five locations that standard Warp Totems will teleport players to:  The Farm, The Mountain, The Beach, The Desert, and Ginger Island.
Note that on the day of the Luau and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies, the Warp Totem: Beach will be consumed upon use, but will not transport the player to the Beach outside of festival time. During festival time, the totem will be consumed, and will transport the player to the festival, as if they had entered the beach via the bridge from Pelican Town.
