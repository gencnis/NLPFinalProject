The Green Bean is a vegetable crop that grows from Bean Starter after 10 days.
This crop uses a trellis, and continues to produce after maturity. Be aware, you cannot move onto a tile with a trellis, but you must be adjacent to a planted tile in order to harvest the plant. You must plan the layout of your plantings in order to guarantee access for harvesting.
