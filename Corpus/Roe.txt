Roe are fish eggs that are produced by fish in a Fish Pond.
The selling price of Roe depends on the fish's base sell price.  The equation is 30 + (base fish sell price / 2), rounded down to the next nearest integer.  The health and energy gained from eating roe are the same for all types of roe, including Sturgeon Roe.
All types of roe can be placed in a Preserves Jar to create a higher-value Artisan Good: Sturgeon Roe creates Caviar; other roe create fish-specific varieties of Aged Roe.
Roe does not belong to any category and therefore it does not benefit from any Profession. It also cannot be sold to Pierre's General Store, but it can be sold to the Fish Shop or placed in the Shipping Bin. At the Stardew Valley Fair, Roe is considered uncategorised (trash), and gives 2-3 points for judging.

Roe Types
All fish produce roe, except those that cannot be put in Fish Ponds (i.e., Legendary Fish) and the two varieties of Squid (which produce Squid Ink instead).  As for the two non-fish that can be put in Fish Ponds, Sea Urchins produce roe, but Coral doesn't.
The price and color of each roe is dependent upon the fish. In general, the color matches the dye color of the fish;[1] Sturgeon are an exception and have black-colored roe, which is used as a blue dye in Dye Pots. Orange is used for any fish that does not have a dye color, although this is not the same color as the generic Roe image, which is a mix of orange and pink eggs.  Despite the variety of displayed colors, all types of roe create orange dye.
