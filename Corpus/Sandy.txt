“

“My name's not really Sandy, you know. It's just good for business.”


— Sandy


Sandy is a villager who lives in the Calico Desert where she runs the store, the Oasis.  Players won't meet her until they've repaired the bus by completing the vault bundle or purchasing "Bus" for 40,000g through the Joja Community Development Form.

Schedule
Sandy does not leave the Oasis, and can be found there when the store is open, from 9am to 11:50pm except on her birthday, Fall 15. On Fall 15, the Oasis is open in the morning but at 1pm Sandy leaves to walk around the desert with Emily.
Sandy never visits the Beach Resort on Ginger Island.

Relationships
Sandy allows Mr. Qi to operate his casino behind her shop. It's clear they're not close, but she accepts his money and "looks the other way" with whatever he's doing back there. She mentions that she's friends with Emily; during the first meeting with the player she mentions that Emily wrote to her about "the new farmer" in town. She also mentions that "my friend runs a shop in the desert", referring to the Desert Trader.

Quotes
First Meeting




“

“A... customer?
Hi! Welcome to 'Sandy's Oasis'!
Hey, you look just like the new farmer that Emily wrote to me about!
Then... the bus line to Stardew Valley is back in service! Oh, I'm so happy!”



Regular




“

“Hello hello, sweetie! I'm so glad that the bus is back in service. It was starting to get lonely out here. ...I almost went out of business. Hey, but now you're here to buy a whole bunch of seeds... right, sweetie?”





“

“You can find coconuts and cactus fruits outside. Feel free to take as many as you can find. They're oooh-yummy, too. Heeee!”





“

“Why hello there! If you see my friend Emily in town, could you tell her I said 'Hi'? Thanks!”





“

“That shady-looking guy in the back? I'm not supposed to talk about it. Anyway... what's the weather like in the valley?”





“

“You wouldn't have much luck farming out here, honey. Well, unless you were a cactus farmer.”





“

“Hi! Welcome to Sandy's Oasis, the number one destination in Calico Desert!
*whisper* Did I sound professional? Make sure to check out our seasonal seed selection.
You look really thirsty. Here, have a taste of this ice cold milk. [gifts Player milk] Tasty, huh?”






“

“It's always sunny here, even in winter! Actually, it's a little hot for my tastes... my delicate skin burns quickly in the sun.”


4+ Hearts




“

“Hey... I think I can trust you. You can keep a secret, right? *whisper* That guy in the back... it's some kind of exclusive club. I've never been inside myself, but they pay me a generous monthly rent so I don't ask any questions. SOOOOoo! How's that Stardew Valley weather right now?”





“

“My name's not really Sandy, you know. It's just good for business. But everyone calls me Sandy anyway, so I've just gotten used to it.”


8+ Hearts




“

“Isn't it expensive, coming to the desert so often like you do? You must really like to see me, huh? Hmmm...”





“

“Hi there, honey. Yep, it's just me, alone in this big old shop. Hmmm... Well, except for that creepy guy in the back. But he never moves a muscle, so I often forget about him.”


10 Hearts




“

“Hey, it's [Player]! I'm glad to see you, kid. I was starting to think you'd never come back!
If I didn't have this shop to run I'd come back to the valley with you for a day or two... just you and me on the old farm.
You'll just have to visit me more often so I don't get depressed.”






“

“Hi!~ Stay as long as you like. The air conditioning sure feels nice, doesn't it?”


After you receive "club card" and get rid of Bouncer




“

“What happened? You're a club member?!”
