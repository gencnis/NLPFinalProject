Relationships

“

“Dear Emily,
I know you only think of me as a friend.
It's my fault. I'm too shy. I'll never have the courage to tell you the truth.
That's why I'm writing this letter to myself that I'll certainly crumple up and toss in the corner.”

Quotes


Regular 



First Meeting




“

“Er... hi. I'm Clint. I'm the town blacksmith. If you ever need to upgrade your tools, I'm your guy.”


Regular




“

“If you want me to upgrade your tools you'll have to give me the correct ore. And you'll have to pay me a fee, of course.”





“

“Hey. What do you need?”





“

“Business has been slow lately. You should upgrade your tools. I could use the cash.”





“

“The weather doesn't really matter to me. I typically stay near my shop year-round. Depressing, huh?”





“

“Sometimes I wonder how I ended up in this town.”





“

“Don't you have work to do?”





“

“So how are your tools holding up?”





“

“Yep. I'm a blacksmith. My father was also a blacksmith. My grandfather was a blacksmith as well.
I bet you can't guess what my great-grandfather was...

A blacksmith. (+30 friendship.)
"How'd you know?"
A silly clown. (+50 friendship.)
"Hahahaha. Good one."
A sarcastic jerk. (-50 friendship.)
"Wow. That was rude. I was just being funny and you took it to a whole new level.”


After passing out in the Mines




“

“...I found you unconscious in the mines. I think I blew my back out, dragging you all the way up here. Be a little more careful next time, okay?”


6+ Hearts




“

“Oh, hi [Player]. Sorry If I look a little messy. I've been working at the furnace all morning. So, did you need anything, or do you just want to visit?”





“

“Damn it, I'm too old to do anything exciting anymore. All I have to look forward to is years and years of sweaty, hot furnace-work.”


Summer




“

“Be glad you're a farmer, [Player]. It's nicer to work outdoors than by a hot furnace all day. I'm only a blacksmith because my father pushed me into it.”





“

“Business has been slow lately. You should upgrade your tools. I could use the cash.”


At Ginger Island




“

“I'm gonna put on my special red trunks. They're supposed to be really eye-catching.”





“

“Oh no... I forgot to clip my toenails.”





“

“I thought working a furnace would have prepared me for this heat, but I'm sweating in places I didn't know I could. I hope no one noticed...”





“

“Ow... my whole torso is burnt to a crisp.”





“

“I'm hungry...”





“

“*sigh*... We're all at the beach but I still feel so alone...”





“

“Well, that didn't turn out like I was imagining...”

Quests
"Forging Ahead": The morning after you collect your first Copper Ore, Clint will visit and give you the blueprints for crafting a Furnace.
"Clint's Attempt": Clint will send you a letter on the 6th of Winter asking that you give Emily an Amethyst and tell her it's from him.  The reward is 1 Friendship heart with Emily.
"A Favor for Clint": Clint will send you a letter on the 17th of Winter asking you to bring him an Iron Bar.  The reward is 500g and 1 Friendship heart.
Clint may randomly request ores or coal at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store.  The reward is an amount of gold that varies by requested item/amount.
Note that you do not need to have any ore/coal in inventory to finish the quest.  Once the required items are gathered, simply talking to Clint will complete the quest.  Handing him any amount of ore or coal will always result in gifting him one of them.
Clint may randomly request that you kill a certain number of Monsters or bring him a random item at the "Help Wanted" board.  The reward for killing monsters is an amount of gold that varies by the type and number of monsters requested.  The reward for item delivery is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
"Cave Patrol": On the Special Orders board in front of the Mayor's Manor, Clint may randomly request that the player slay 50 Bats, Dust Sprites, Skeletons, or Grubs. The reward is 6,000g and the Geode Crusher recipe.
Portraits






























































Trivia
According to a tape in a boombox in Clint's room, he is a fan of the blues.
As shown in the picture of him holding a Joja Cola, Clint has only four fingers on his left hand.
Clint's 7 heart recipe is the Bean Hotpot, and Emily has a quote during Winter asking if the player knows how to cook that recipe. This hints that Clint has perhaps introduced her to the dish, or learned it for her.
Developer ConcernedApe has stated that Clint's age is "late 30s-40ish" (arguing with my friends about how old we/ source).
History
1.4: Fixed bug where all recipes would be sent at 3 friendship hearts.  Fixed bug where 6 heart event wouldn't trigger if entering town on a horse.  Removed ore gathering quest exploits.
1.5: Added beach portraits.
