The Acorn is a seed that grows into an Oak Tree.  It can be obtained by shaking/chopping down an Oak Tree at Foraging level 1, in Garbage Cans, or by using an Axe or Pickaxe to dig up an Acorn dropped by a fully grown Oak Tree on The Farm.  One to five acorns may be produced in a Woodskip Fish Pond when the population reaches 9.
Acorns can be planted in tillable ground outside The Farm. The ground must be un-tilled to plant the seed.
An acorn has approximately a 20% chance to grow to the next stage each night during Spring, Summer, or Fall. There are 5 stages of growth in total. The median time to maturity is about 18 days, with over 90% of seeds maturing in less than 32 growing days.
The use of Tree Fertilizer guarantees growth by one stage each night, including during winter.
