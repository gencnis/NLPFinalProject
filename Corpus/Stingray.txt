Tailoring
Stingray can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Sailor Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Stingrays can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing two quests. The primary output is dark brown Stingray Roe, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 4.
