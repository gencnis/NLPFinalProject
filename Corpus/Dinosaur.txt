The Dinosaur is a farm animal that lives in a Big Coop. Dinosaurs can be hatched by placing a Dinosaur Egg into an Incubator, taking  18,000m (11d 6h 40m) to incubate, or  9,000m (5d 16h 40m) with the Coopmaster Profession.

Selling
It is possible to sell the Dinosaur. A Dinosaur with more hearts sells for more gold. A Dinosaur with maximum hearts sells for 1,300g. A dinosaur with no hearts sells for 315g.
Note that a dinosaur with 0 hearts of friendship technically sells for 300g, but the player cannot access the 'sell' menu without petting the dinosaur, which gives 15 friendship points (30 with the Coopmaster profession), and increases the sell price to 315g (330g with Coopmaster).
To sell a coop or barn animal, right-click the animal after petting. The friendship/mood interface appears. Move the cursor over the gold coin button at the right to see how much the animal can be sold for. Click that button and the confirmation that follows to complete the sale.
