The Mega Bomb is a one-time use explosive item. It damages certain items within its radius.  Other items are impervious to its effects.
Mega Bombs can be crafted or purchased from the Dwarf (in The Mines and in the Volcano Dungeon) for 1,000g.  Kent may randomly send a Mega Bomb in the mail.  Squid Kids, Iridium Bats, and Haunted Skulls may also drop a Mega Bomb when slain. The Desert Trader will trade 5 Iridium Ore for 1 Mega Bomb. It can be won from the Crane Game inside the Movie Theater, during any season.  Five Mega Bombs may occasionally be found in Treasure Rooms in the Skull Cavern. 3-5 Mega Bombs may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least two times.
Tip: Due to the wide blast area it is often a challenge to use the Mega Bomb without taking damage. Ensure ample healing supplies are available when using this.

Crafted artisan and refining equipment will be destroyed.
Heaters will be destroyed.
Auto-Grabbers will not be destroyed, whether empty or containing items.
Trees will be destroyed when their health reaches zero (this may require more than one bomb).  Trees will drop wood, sap, and any seeds they contained.
