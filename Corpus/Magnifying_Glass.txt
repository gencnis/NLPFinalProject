"A Winter Mystery" Quest


Sell Price:

Cannot be sold


The Magnifying Glass allows the player to find Secret Notes while tilling soil, chopping trees, mining, fishing, or killing monsters.
The Magnifying Glass is obtained by completing the "A Winter Mystery" Quest.  This quest is added to the journal after triggering a cutscene by entering the Bus Stop from The Farm during Winter between 6am and 4pm.  The cutscene depicts a "Shadow Guy" who is startled by the player, and runs away.
Completing the quest requires the player to interact with a bush next to the playground, left of the Community Center, triggering another cutscene in which the Shadow Guy gives the player the Magnifying Glass. 
Once obtained, it can be found in the wallet in the The Player's Menu on the Skills tab.
