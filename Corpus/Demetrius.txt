“

“I'm studying the local plants and animals from my home laboratory. Have you met my daughter Maru? She's interested to meet you.”


— Demetrius


Demetrius is a villager who resides at 24 Mountain Road, on The Mountain, with his wife Robin, daughter Maru, and step-son Sebastian.
Demetrius is a scientist who studies the valley's local wildlife. He can often be found working in his laboratory or outdoors taking notes.

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Demetrius may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Demetrius will immediately go home to bed. Demetrius never visits the Resort on Festival days or his checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.

You see Demetrius and Robin arguing. She asked him to get fruit, so he got tomatoes. She exclaims that tomatoes aren't what he should have thought of because they're not "real" fruit. He defends himself by saying that tomatoes are indeed a fruit and his mistake was reasonable. He asks you to choose whether tomatoes are fruits or vegetables. Your response will affect his friendship with you.

“

“Let's see... If compounds in the rhizosphere contain sufficient levels of Carbon-13, then... Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there. Do you need anything?”





“

“It's good to take a break from work every now and then. I guess that's kind of difficult when you live on a farm, though. Hey, at least in the winter you don't have to worry about crops.”





“

“How's the farming business going? It's [crop] season, isn't it? I can imagine it being pretty peaceful, working outdoors with plants all day.”

“Robin has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side. ...now if I could only quantify her mood levels, perhaps I could model the fluctuations using a sinusoidal curve...”

6+ Hearts




“

“Hi [Player]! How are you doing today? I wish I could make your farming job easier somehow.”

Summer




“

“

“Make sure to water your plants every day. Although, if you're using water retaining soil you don't need to worry about watering as often. It's pretty convenient.”





“

“If you and Maru become friends, I'm sure she'll show you how to use that telescope out back. Pretty exciting, huh?”





“

“Hmm... If strigolactone levels could be increased, would it have a proportional effect on mycorhizal growth? Oh! Sorry. I was pondering some data and I didn't notice you there. Do you need anything?”


Fall

“

“Do you have any animals on your farm?”





“

“Let's see... if seasonal nitrogen levels could be modeled by a piecewise function... Oh! Sorry. I was analyzing data and I didn't notice you there. Do you need anything?”





“

“Feel free to harvest as much lumber and stone from this area as you please.”


At Ginger Island




“

“I already spotted a rare crab. This place is great.”





“

“Can you believe this place? It's teeming with exotic life!”





“

“*crunch*... whoops, there goes an endangered crab species... #Oh, nevermind. It was just the empty shell! I can sleep tonight.”





“

“Are you having fun, [Player]? You need to remember to take breaks now and then too!”





“

“I usually don't partake... but I'm usually not on a tropical island, either. Hahaha.”





“

“I'll be analyzing this data for months.”
