Mutant Grubs are an enemy found in the Mutant Bug Lair.  Mutant Grubs count towards the 125 Cave Insects killed for Monster Eradication Goals.

Behavior
Mutant Grubs appear in groups and attack on sight.
Upon sustaining critical damage, they will flee and attempt to pupate. When pupating, a Mutant Grub turns darker green and is immune to all damage. It will emerge as a Mutant Fly.

Strategy
Attempt to separate them from their groups to avoid being overrun.
If you find a single grub, simply attack it constantly and chase it down if it tries to escape. They do not charge you like slimes do, making it impossible for them to hit you if you have a weapon with decent knockback. 
If you encounter a group of grubs, use a weapon with medium or high knockback to push them all into a corner, that way none of them can escape. Just make sure to not let any escape from the corner, as fighting a flying insect and a group of grubs is quite dangerous, especially if there are a lot of grubs. Explosive ammo from your slingshot also works well.
