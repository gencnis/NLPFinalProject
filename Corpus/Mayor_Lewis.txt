“

“I've been Mayor of Pelican Town for over twenty years! No one ever runs against me when it's time for an election. I like to think that it means I'm doing my job well. I like being Mayor.”


— Lewis


Lewis is the mayor of Pelican Town. Along with Robin, he greets you when you move to the Valley and explains a little bit about life on the farm. Lewis is known to have some sort of relations with Marnie, as the shorts he lost and brown suspenders are found in her bedroom. Furthermore, a note can be found in his bedroom in the lower left on a shelf under a coffee mug, believed to be from Marnie. The note is signed "-M"
When a festival takes place, you will receive a letter in your mail box, usually from Lewis, that tells you where and when it takes place, as well as any additional requirements.

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Lewis may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Lewis will immediately go home to bed. Lewis never visits the Resort on Festival days or his checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.

Relationships
As nobody has challenged Lewis for his title of mayor in the twenty years he has held the position, we can assume he has a good relationship with everyone living in Pelican Town. He was apparently good friends with the player's grandfather; if the player speaks to him while he is at The Stardrop Saloon, Lewis states that he will be having an extra drink in your grandfather's honor.
In parallel with his work as mayor, he is also involved in the Stardew Valley Agricultural Fund. He may send the player a letter that includes money from the fund, "to help you continue your good work," such as using it to buy seeds.
He has never been married and has no family; all he lives for is being mayor. He sometimes questions if it was worth it.
Lewis is particularly good friends with Marnie, as shown in the "Mayor's Shorts" story quest.  He can also sometimes be found inside Marnie's Ranch saying, "I'm just here to make sure all of Marnie's business needs are met." Additionally, his and Marnie's 6-heart event confirms that they're in a relationship, although he doesn't want the relationship to become public knowledge.

Lewis says it would undermine his authority, while Marnie says he's too concerned for his job.  In the end, Marnie says she'll keep their relationship a secret.  Afterwards, you'll pop up and scare both Lewis and Marnie.  Lewis asks you if you heard anything, and you are presented with a choice.
Yes... but I'll keep it a secret. (+50 friendship  with Lewis.)
Yes... and I'm going to tell everyone. (-100 friendship  with Lewis.)
If you choose to keep the secret, Lewis will thank you.  If you say you'll tell everyone in town, Lewis will cry.  Afterwards, Marnie will ask why you were behind the house, and your character will run away, leaving the two alone and confused.

Stardew Valley Fair

“Well [Player], It's the big day... Our most important festival of the year, the 'Stardew Valley Fair'. If you'd like to participate by setting up a grange display, I've left an empty stand for you. Just let me know after you've set everything up so we can get to the judging.”

Quests
"Mayor's Shorts": Lewis will send you a letter on the 3rd of Summer explaining that he lost his shorts and offers a reward to anyone who can find and return them to him discreetly.  You earn 750g and 1 Friendship heart for completing the quest.
If instead the player chooses to place the shorts in their Grange display during Fall, Mayor Lewis will instead be upset, calling it a "sick joke" and pay the player off with 750 Star Tokens, demanding they return his shorts the following day. The player can decide to keep them however and repeat this the following year, without loss in friendship points.
If instead the player chooses to add the shorts as a "special ingredient" to the soup present at the Luau festival a unique dialogue involving the Governor and Lewis transpires. It should also be noted that this doesn't gain or drain any favour from the valleys Villagers.
"Mayor's Need": Lewis will send you a letter on the 21st of Summer in year 2 asking you to bring him a bottle of Truffle Oil.  The reward is 750g and 1 Friendship heart.
Lewis may request that you slay a random number of Monsters or bring him a random item at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store.  The reward for slaying monsters varies by the number and type of monster, but is always an amount of gold.  The reward for completing an item delivery request is 3x the item's base value and 150 Friendship points.
"Crop Order": On the Special Orders board in front of the Mayor's Manor, Lewis may randomly request that the player harvest and ship 100 season-dependent crops. The reward is gold equal to 50% of the sell price of the crop and a Mini-Shipping Bin.
