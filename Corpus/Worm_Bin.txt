The Worm Bin is a craftable item that can be used to create  Bait for fishing. The crafting recipe is unlocked at fishing level 8.
It automatically creates 2-5 pieces of bait every morning.

Cost
The resources needed to construct a Worm Bin will sell for 845g, without any professions. This means that it will take a Worm Bin about 42 days to pay for itself. If buying the materials (in year one), a single Worm Bin will instead cost 4,675g, and will take 267 days to pay for itself.

Worm bins outside the farm
It is possible to place chests and other crafted items outside the farm.  Chests are useful for storing gifts close to the homes of Villagers who prefer them or to allow additional storage when Mining, Fishing, or Foraging.  Worm Bins can be placed near fishing spots, Furnaces can be placed at the entrance to The Mines, and entire sections of the Valley may be utilized for Keg or Preserves Jar processing. Common Trees can be planted in tillable soil and tapped.
If a villager walks through the square where a crafted item was placed, the item will be destroyed. Below are player-created maps to indicate which tiles on the map are safe from villager-pathing. The tiles with the Rotten Plant should be safe.
Safe-pathing images of the interiors of homes and buildings can be found in the complete image gallery located at https://imgur.com/a/JlRXGlc
Note that items placed on the docks at the beach may be destroyed by villagers during the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies, or by Emily if married to her.  The image below is accurate for players who do not attend the festival and don't marry Emily.
Note for v1.5 only: Leo has additional pathing requirements
