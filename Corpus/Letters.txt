Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

Letters are messages sent to the player that can be read by interacting with the mailbox that is located on The Farm and the Ginger Island Farm. They appear at the start of the day in the player's mailbox on specific days or the day after certain conditions have been met. Letters contain rewards, information about the game's mechanics, hints, reminders and lore. 
Closing a letter with an unclaimed item will automatically attempt to place it into the inventory, provided the player has enough inventory space. Otherwise, a menu will appear, similar to the treasure chest menu, allowing the player to make room for the item. Dismissing this menu will forfeit the rewarded item.
Most letters received in the mail will be added to the collection tab. The tab does not record notices received from passing out at 2am or from low health. Letters shown do not include any attachments that came with the original letter, such as recipes or the name of the secret gift recipient at the Feast of the Winter Star.

 Elliott

<Player>, my love,I've just arrived in Grampleton, to start the tour. I've forgotten how hectic the city is! The streets are packed with people... they either seem in a mad hurry, or lost in a daze, unaware of their surroundings. I miss Pelican Town already!I begin the tour this evening, at a local bookstore. I must admit, I'm becoming a bit nervous at the thought of public speaking... my stomach feels as if it's been twisted into a soft pretzel and doused with spicy cheese dip. Wish me luck!-Love, ElliottP.S. I hope you had a peaceful night, and weren't too scared all alone in that big house!

My dear <player>,The first reading went well, though the audience was a bit smaller than I'd hoped. Still, I sold enough copies of the book to pay for my (bug-infested) hotel room!In a few hours, I leave for Zuzu City. If yesterday's reading was a warm-up, this next one will be a true napalm blast...I miss you very much. Remember to eat well! Oh, and don't forget the leftover crab cakes I put in the fridge...-Love, Elliott

 Elliott

My sweet <player>,Last night in Zuzu City was quite the experience! It seems there's a large literary scene here... a few dozen people showed up at my reading!I even signed a couple of autographs... it's strange to be seen as someone important. It's all a matter of framing, a grand illusion... for truly I am no one special. Only your devoted Elliott, as always.Currently I'm alone, in my hotel room, 'ingesting' a Joja Value Meal...Should this be called 'food'?Or 'edible matter'?I needn't long broodIt must be the latterI look forward to returning home soon. Hope you enjoyed the crab cakes.-Love, Elliott

In dreams, when graced with lofty viewI gaze upon the sunlit seaWhat distant shores I've travelled toBut time now clouds my memoryThere is but one eternal placeWhere I shall someday pass beyondIn Valley dear, where my love waits:Our little home beside the pond-Elliott

 Elliott

My dear <player>,I won't bore you with any more details about my readings. They are mostly the same.I'm sure your time has been much more exciting! I can't wait to return and see what progress has been made.On these long travels between towns, I amuse myself by closing my eyes and envisioning the farm... I see kegs pulsing with sweet wine, a furnace ablaze with precious ore, and our little kitchen with the smell of cinnamon and nutmeg. There's a lot to enjoy!Just don't stay out too late in the mines, my love. It's dangerous in there! If you must go... bring plenty of food.-Love, Elliott

 Elliott

My dear <player>,This will be my last letter before I return home. I've had a fine trip... though nothing too exciting. It's been nice to meet people who enjoy my work, but I'm eager to return home.I look forward to the comfort of our little house, the satisfying farm work, a home-cooked meal, and most of all, cozying into the flannel sheets with you.See you soon!-Love, Elliott
