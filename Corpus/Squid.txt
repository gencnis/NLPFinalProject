The Squid is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at The Beach or on the Beach Farm in the evening during Winter. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Winter, or at the Traveling Cart for 240-1,000g.
When placed in a Fish Pond this fish will produce Squid Ink instead of Roe.
Squid can be caught regardless of time of day or season using Magic Bait.
