Lava Crabs are an enemy found in the Mines. 60 rock crabs (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

Behavior
They disguise themselves as stones, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again.

Strategy
Lava Crabs may be differentiated from rocks by striking them with a weapon.  A Lava Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a weapon, while a rock will not.
The Lava Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell.  Strike an immobile Lava Crab with a pickaxe to make it mobile again. 
Striking a Lava Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near a Lava Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well.


History
1.0: Introduced.
1.4: Fixed bug that caused striking an unshelled crab with a pickaxe to produce the same sounds and debris as hitting a rock. Dropped Crabs now always bounce around before being taken into inventory, instead of bouncing only when inventory was full.
