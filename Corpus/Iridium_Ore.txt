Locations
The Traveling Cart will occasionally sell it for 300-1,000g.
The Mines: A fairly reliable source of the ore is through Magma and Omni Geodes on lower mine levels. These can be obtained frequently by mining all rocks on mine levels 115-119. To further enhance geode frequency, choose the Geologist Profession at mining level 5 and the Excavator Profession at mining level 10.
A fallen meteorite on The Farm will drop 6 Iridium Ore.
Iridium Nodes and Mystic Stones can be found in the Quarry.
Skull Cavern: The chance to find Iridium Ore increases steadily the further one descends into the Skull Cavern.  Stone can be bought from the Carpenter's Shop to craft a staircase. Staircases can also be bought from the Desert Trader for 1 Jade each on Sundays. Large amounts of staircases or bombs can get one deep into Skull Cavern quickly.
Purple slimes in the Skull Cavern or a Slime Hutch have a chance to drop both iridium ore and bars.
Iridium Bats in the Skull Cavern may drop an Iridium Bar (0.8% chance) and up to 4 Iridium Ore when slain.
Iridium Crabs in the Skull Cavern may drop up to 3 Iridium Ore when slain.
A Super Cucumber Fish Pond may produce 1-3 Iridium Ore when the population of the pond reaches 9.
Krobus sells 1 Omni Geode each Tuesday for 300g each and The Oasis sells 3 Omni Geodes each Wednesday for 1,000g each, which can then be broken by Clint or with a Geode Crusher.  There is a 5% chance an Omni Geode will contain 1-11 Iridium Ore.
The Statue Of Perfection, which can be obtained after getting four candles during Grandpa's Evaluation, gives the player 2-8 Iridium Ore per day.
Smelting
Iridium Ore can be smelted in a Furnace to create an Iridium Bar.  The smelting requires 5 iridium ore and 1 Coal and takes 8 in-game hours.

Bundles

When used with Slingshots, Iridium Ore deals more damage to monsters than any other ammunition.
