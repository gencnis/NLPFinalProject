The Chicken is a farm animal that lives in a Coop. Chickens can be purchased at Marnie's Ranch for 800g or hatched by placing an Egg into an Incubator, taking  9,000m (5d 16h 40m) to incubate, or  4,500m (2d 21h 40m) with the Coopmaster Profession.

Color
Chickens are colored White, Brown, or Blue. The Blue variety can be obtained only after seeing Shane's 8-heart event. The color of the chicken is assigned randomly by the game when a chicken is purchased or hatched, so restarting a day after hatching a chicken may produce a different color.
The color of a chicken is shown during purchase from Marnie's Ranch, while selecting a coop. A message is shown stating "Choose a Coop for your new White/Brown/Blue Chicken". Cancelling the purchase returns the player to the purchase window, where they can try again for the desired color.
White and blue chickens produce white eggs, and brown chickens produce brown eggs, so it makes a difference in completing the Community Center Bundles, especially if Remixed Bundles is not chosen at start of game.

Produce
Main article: Animals#Produce
Chickens who eat every day mature after 3 nights have passed. A mature and fed chicken produces a white or brown Egg every day, which can be placed in an Incubator to hatch another chicken, or sold for 50g. Once sufficient friendship and happiness is reached, it has a chance to produce a Large Egg or Large Brown Egg which sells for 95g.
An Egg can be placed in the Mayonnaise Machine to produce Mayonnaise, which sells for 190g or 285g depending on quality.

Blue Chickens
 A blue chickAfter seeing Shane's 8-heart event, each chicken you purchase from Marnie or hatch from a brown or white egg has a 25% chance of being blue. Aside from appearance, blue chickens are identical to regular white and brown chickens. One subtle benefit to this alternative color is that blue chickens are much easier to spot in a field of grass.
Blue chickens are hatched as blue chicks.

Selling
It is possible to sell Chickens. The amount of gold obtained for doing so is dependent on how many hearts the animal has. The more hearts; the higher amount of gold fetched for selling it. The amount of gold obtained for selling a maximum-heart Chicken is 1,040g.
To sell a coop or barn animal, right-click the animal after petting. The friendship/mood interface appears. Move the cursor over the gold coin button at the right to see how much you can sell the animal for. Click that button and the confirmation that follows to complete the sale.

Trivia
Blue chickens may be a reference to "Cojiro", one of a species of chicken called "cucco" in the game "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time".
A blue chicken egg was added to the game Terraria with ConcernedApe's permission in October 2022.
