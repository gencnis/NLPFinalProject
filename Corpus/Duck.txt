Selling
It is possible to sell Ducks. The amount of gold obtained for doing so is dependent on how many hearts the animal has. The more hearts; the higher amount of gold fetched for selling it. The amount of gold obtained for selling a maximum-heart Duck is 1,560g and for a recently hatched Baby Duck without any hearts 395g.
To sell a coop or barn animal, right-click the animal after petting. The friendship/mood interface appears. Move the cursor over the gold coin button at the right to see how much the animal can be sold for. Click that button and the confirmation that follows to complete the sale.

Trivia
In the game, the female, egg-laying ducks have green heads. In actuality, male Mallard ducks have the characteristic green heads. Females are brown. However, domesticated Cayuga ducks have green feathers in both genders.
Ducklings make the same noises as adult ducks.
