This article is about the cooking ingredient. For the harvested crop, see Unmilled Rice. For the seed, see Rice Shoot.
Rice is a cooking ingredient that can be used in a variety of recipes. It can be purchased for 200g at Pierre's General Store and for 250g at JojaMart.
Players have the ability to craft Rice from Unmilled Rice by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one Unmilled Rice will make one Rice. Unmilled Rice placed inside will appear as Rice in the box beside the Mill the next morning. The building can process an unlimited amount of rice per day.
Note: Rice made using the mill is profitable; it has a higher sell price than Unmilled Rice. However, using Preserves Jars would be slightly more profitable per unit of rice if there is sufficient capacity, as the resulting pickles would sell for 110g.
