The Coop is a type of farm building purchasable and upgradable from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop. It takes three days to build, and two days to upgrade.
The coop can house chickens, ducks, rabbits, and dinosaurs.  Once you have unlocked an animal by building the coop needed to house it, that animal can be placed in any other non-upgraded coops you have built as well. 
The total cost of a Deluxe Coop, built from scratch, is 34,000g,  Wood (1200) and  Stone (450) (Or, if all wood and stone are bought from Robin during year 1, 55,000g, and 139,000g if bought in year 2+.)
The Deluxe Coop features an Autofeed System; hay from your silos will be automatically distributed. (You can still let the animals feed on grass outside, and the hay will not be eaten.)
Coop Animals may be stuck outside at night if the coop doors are closed. The conditions for this are not clear (see Animals trapped outside). If an animal is stuck outside the coop at night, the next day their mood will be "grumpy." Animals stuck outside are also subject to Wild Animal Attacks.
