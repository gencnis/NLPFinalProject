This article is about the Pelican Town quarry. For Ginger Island, see Ginger Island#Dig Site.
The Quarry consists of a large area with a wide selection of rocks and mining nodes that are randomly generated.  Each day there is a chance that new rocks and nodes as well as oak and maple tree seeds will be generated.  It is part of the same map as the Mountain, therefore it has the same forageable items and Artifact Spot contents as the Mountain.
The Quarry is unlocked by completing the Crafts Room bundles in the Community Center or by purchasing "Bridge" from the Joja Community Development Form for 25,000g. 
The Quarry itself can be home to every ore and gem in the game. However, stones containing valuable items like Iridium Ore or Prismatic Shards are much rarer and the player may have to wait several seasons for new ones to spawn.
The Entrance to the Quarry Mine is on the western side of the quarry, above the bridge.  The Minecart unlocked by either completing the Boiler Room bundles or by purchasing "Minecarts" from the Joja Community Development Form at JojaMart for 15,000g can also take the player to the Quarry once the bridge is repaired.

Strategy
Each day new rocks, nodes, oak and maple seeds will spawn, so to prevent valuable spawns from being blocked by existing rocks, it is wise to keep the quarry entirely cleared.
Using bombs in the quarry destroys rocks, ore nodes, and gem nodes (including the Mystic Stone), leaving stones, ore, and gems to collect.  Bombs also destroy trees, leaving wood, sap, and possibly tree seeds.

Usable Space
 
This image shows the usable space in the Quarry. Colored tiles (yellow or blue) can be used to place paths, artisan equipment and refining equipment. Yellow tiles (tillables) may also be used to plant common trees.
Villagers do not travel through the Quarry or on its bridge, so items placed there are safe from destruction.
