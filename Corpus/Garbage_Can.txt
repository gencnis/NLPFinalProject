Garbage Can

For the upgradeable garbage cans found in the player menu, see Trash Cans.
Garbage Cans can be found next to buildings in Pelican Town.  If you "use" one (right-click on it), you can sometimes find a valuable item. There are eight garbage cans in total: 
The Stardrop Saloon, 1 River Road, the Mayor's Manor, 1 Willow Lane, 2 Willow Lane,  the Blacksmith, the Museum and JojaMart/Movie Theater.
Garbage cans have predetermined contents each day. The chance for this predetermined item to drop is affected by daily luck. In addition, certain garbage cans have special drops which have a chance to replace the predetermined drop. This chance is partially affected by daily luck.
Garbage Cans will play an animation when interacted with.  The top comes off briefly, revealing that the trash inside changes color with the seasons.  A Garbage Can's lid may randomly pop off extra high and play an extra loud sound. In addition, if a Garbage Hat is found, the can's lid will make an exploding noise, and the lid will disappear for a period of time.

Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter

If you interact with a garbage can near any villager other than Linus, you will repulse the villager and lose 25 friendship points with them.  The villager must be in a 15x15 square centered at your character to be offended.  If Linus catches you digging through a Garbage Can, you will gain 5 friendship points with him.[1]
Linus' attitude towards digging through garbage cans is revealed in his 50-points heart event, but it rarely matters since (other than during the cutscene) he can only be seen in town one day a year, on Winter 15, walking to the Night Market.
