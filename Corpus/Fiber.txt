Fiber is a resource obtained by destroying Weeds or harvesting fully-grown Fiber Seeds. Each weed has a 50% chance to drop 1 Fiber when cut with a Scythe, Axe, Pickaxe, Hoe, or Sword, or blown up by a bomb. The Desert Trader will also exchange five stone for one fiber on Tuesdays.
Weeds that drop Fiber can frequently be found in high quantities on Floors 25-29 and 81-109 of the Mines. The late-game Mutant Bug Lair is also a good source, generating 40-70 fiber from its weeds, which regenerate every few days.
Wilderness Golems on the Wilderness Farm map have a 90% chance of dropping Fiber, and a 50% chance of dropping a second Fiber, when slain.
Fiber is always normal quality.
