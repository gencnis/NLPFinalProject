Behavior
They fly towards the player and will teleport to a random location after they hit the player. They can pass through walls and "black space" to reach the player.

Strategy
Stand still and swing at it with a sword right before it hits the character.  High-damage but slow weapons are more efficient than quick, low-damage weapons such as daggers.  Ghosts are knocked back several tiles after being hit, so walking towards them may speed up the process of killing them.  Otherwise, wait until they slowly float back towards the character for another strike.

Notes
Ectoplasm can only drop if the "A Curious Substance" quest is active.
History
1.3.27: Introduced.
1.5: Added a 9.5% drop chance for Ectoplasm if the "A Curious Substance" quest is active.
