The Coconut is an inedible Foraged Fruit found in the Calico Desert and by shaking palm trees on Ginger Island.  It can also be bought at the Oasis on Mondays for 400g or may randomly appear in the Traveling Cart's stock for 300-1,000g. Sandy may also send one in the mail as a gift.
Although it is inedible, it may be put in a Preserves Jar to make Coconut Jelly, or in a Keg to make Coconut Wine. Coconuts cannot be planted to create Palm Trees.
The Island Trader will trade 1 Golden Coconut for 10 Coconuts, provided the player already previously found at least one Golden Coconut.

Tailoring
Coconut is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a  Vacation Shirt. It is a dark brown dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the orange dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in dyeing.

Quests
Gus requests a Coconut by mail on the 19th of Winter (year 2) in the "Exotic Spirits" Quest.  The reward is 600g and 1 Friendship heart.
Coconut may be randomly requested after the player has completed the Vault Bundles at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 300g and 150 Friendship points.
3 Coconuts may be requested by Sandfish or Scorpion Carp in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 3 to 5.
Notes
Normally, coconuts do not receive the +10% Tiller price bonus because they are obtained by foraging (see the Fruit page for details). However, coconuts obtained as gifts or purchases do, and therefore sell for 110g. If stacked with other normal quality Coconuts, the entire stack will receive the price bonus.
Botanically, the coconut is classed as a drupe, or stone fruit (other examples of Drupes are cherries and peaches).
