The Pickaxe is a tool obtained at the beginning of the game. It is used mainly for breaking stones, particularly when Mining, although it has other uses and can also remove certain objects. For example, the pickaxe can be used to pick up placed items, such as floor tiles, sprinklers, or artisan equipment, much like an axe. In a similar way, the pickaxe can also strike small plants like weeds or other crops on the farm to remove them.
Only the pickaxe can un-till soil that has previously been tilled (i.e., it can remove strikes from a Hoe). This process is overall done in two stages; striking once will remove any crops on top, leaving the underlying tilled soil intact (including any fertilizer present).  Striking a second time tilled soil will revert the tile to an un-tilled state, removing any applied fertilizer. The pickaxe also applies this two-stage removal process to for items placed on top of floor tiles, while the axe will remove both the object and the floor at once. Also, using the pickaxe on a Monster will deal a small portion of damage, similar to other weapons. However, another unique use case is hitting a Crab 5 times with a pickaxe which will knock off its shell, and cause the crab to flee rather than attack the player.

Grades of Pickaxe
The Pickaxe may be upgraded at the Blacksmith.  The cost and resource requirements for each upgrade are shown in the table below.  As a summary of the upgrade effects, with each upgrade level the number of hits required to break a stone or node is reduced, and it becomes possible to break harder types of rocks.
