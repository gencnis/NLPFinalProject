Aged Values
Goat Cheese can be placed inside a Cask to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Goat Cheese.  
Normal, silver, and gold quality Goat Cheese can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an Axe, Hoe, or Pickaxe.
