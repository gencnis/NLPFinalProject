White Algae is an item which can be caught with a Fishing Pole during all seasons at any underground location (the Mines, the Sewers, the Mutant Bug Lair, or the Witch's Swamp).
White Algae can also be dropped by several Monsters:  Grubs, Mutant Grubs, Flies, Mutant Flies, Bugs, and Red, Purple, Copper, and Iron Slimes.  A Ghostfish Fish Pond may produce 5 White Algae when the population of the pond reaches 9.
White Algae is displayed in the Fish section of the collection tab, and counts towards the four fishing Achievements.[1]  However, it is otherwise not considered to be a fish, and therefore cannot be sold to Willy at the Fish Shop.
