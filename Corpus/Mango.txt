The Mango is a fruit grown by planting a Mango Sapling, waiting 28 days for it to grow into a Mango Tree, and harvesting the tree.  When planted on Ginger Island, a Mango Tree will produce fruit year-round.  In Stardew Valley, a Mango Tree will produce fruit in Summer. 
The Island Trader exchanges one 'Volcano' Photo for 5 Mangoes on Thursdays.
