The Golden Coconut is found throughout Ginger Island and can be obtained by shaking Palm Trees (10% chance when there is a coconut visible) [1], digging Artifact Spots on Ginger Island, or from a Blue Discus Fish Pond with a population of at least 9.
It can also be purchased from the Island Trader for 10 Coconuts after previously finding and cracking at least one golden coconut.
Golden Coconuts can be cracked by Clint in the Blacksmith shop for 25g, similar to Geodes. However, unlike Geodes, they cannot be broken by a Geode Crusher.

Tips
The player can skip having to forage by buying 10 Coconuts from the Oasis on Mondays, then trading them with the Island Trader for 1 Golden Coconut.
