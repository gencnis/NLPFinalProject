Parrot Hints
Interacting with the parrot in Leo's hut will cause it to squawk hints for more walnut locations. Hints update as the player progresses - quantities change to reflect only unfound walnuts, and hints to walnuts that have already been found no longer appear.

Golden Coconut

Golden Coconuts, found anywhere on Ginger Island, can be brought to the Blacksmith back in Stardew Valley to be opened. The first time Clint opens one, it produces a Golden Walnut.




5

Fishing

A maximum of five Golden Walnuts can be obtained by fishing anywhere on Ginger Island. Until five have been collected in this manner, each cast anywhere on the island gives a 15% chance to obtain a walnut. [1]

Type of Discovery

How to Find

1

Exploration

A walnut in a bush is found in the jungle on the path towards Leo's hut.




3

Puzzle

Place a Banana on the altar by the staircase to Leo's hut. A gorilla appears and rewards the player with 3 walnuts.




1

Puzzle

Hit the tree inside Leo's hut with an axe.




1

Exploration

From the foot of the stairs to Leo's hut, follow the path eastward along a hidden passage to the Gem Bird Shrine. There is a walnut to the south of the shrine.




5

Puzzle

There are four bird statues at the center of the Gem Bird Shrine. Each bird statue is associated with a particular Ginger Island area, as hinted by the carved picture at its base (volcano = north, waves = south, palm tree = east, heart = west).
On rainy days, a single Gem Bird appears in one randomly-selected region of the island (North, South, East, or West). Approaching the Gem Bird causes it to fly away, dropping a gemstone as it does so. The player must collect this gemstone and place it on the bird statue at the shrine that corresponds to the island region in which the Gem Bird appeared.
Gem Birds always appear in at the specific location for their associated island region:


North: South of the Island Field Office Tent.
East: In the middle of the path in the jungle towards Leo's hut.
South: To the southwest of the beach near the docks.
West: West across the river from the farm, east of Birdie's Hut, at the pond.

There are five possible gems: Amethyst, Aquamarine, Emerald, Ruby, and Topaz.
Once the final gemstone is placed, the shrine activates and rewards the player with 5 golden walnuts, completing the puzzle and fulfilling all the related game requirements. The puzzle cannot be completed again to obtain more walnuts, although the statues may still (incorrectly) display plus signs while the player is holding a valid gem near one. Gem birds still appear and drop gems on rainy days even after the puzzle is solved, giving the player the option to collect and keep them, as desired.
Note: The puzzle solution is randomized per game.
Note: The gems placed do not need to be the same ones dropped by the birds - a gem of the correct type from any source will work.

Harvesting

Harvesting crops on the Ginger Island farm occasionally yields golden walnuts, up to a total of 5.




15

Puzzle

After the farmhouse is repaired, the player may talk to the Gourmand Frog. The frog then asks the player to grow a Melon, a Wheat, and a Garlic, in that order. When a crop is mature, leave it unharvested and talk to the frog again to show him the crop. The reward is 5 golden walnuts per crop. Harvest each crop after receiving its reward. The three crops yield a total of 15 walnuts.
Note: All three crops may be planted at any time, together or separately, but they must be presented to the frog in order one at a time and each crop can be harvested only after the frog has seen it and rewarded the player.

Qi's Walnut Room

 1

Notes
The parrot in Leo's hut provides hints for 123 out of 130 walnut locations with the exception of: 

1 on the southern bush in the Gem Birds shrine area
3 for placing a banana on the altar in the east, by the staircase to Leo's hut
up to 3 rewarded for winning the Darts Game.
Bugs
Occasionally the game may miscount the number of Golden Walnuts obtained, leaving the count at 129/130, when all walnuts have actually been found.  The workaround is to open a chat window (with ? or T on PC) and enter /recountnuts.
Occasionally the golden walnut north of the entrance to Qi’s walnut room may fly off screen when shaken (like a Garbage Can lid exploding, but without the sound) and not be counted as collected, making Perfection impossible. The only workaround (other than using Mods) is to exit and restart the day.
