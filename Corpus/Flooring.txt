Flooring is an item that is sold at both Pierre's General Store for 100g and JojaMart for 250g. A new flooring is sold each day. A flooring that is sold at JojaMart will be sold at Pierre's General Store on the following day.
Flooring can also be obtained from the Catalogue, a piece of furniture that can be purchased from Pierre's General Store for 30,000g. The Catalogue provides all flooring (and wallpaper) for 0g wherever the object is placed. The Catalogue always holds every flooring and wallpaper and does not rotate stock.
Floorings are one time use and do not stack. They cover the whole room they're placed in and can also be placed on hallway floors between rooms.
They do not have unique names, so the table below lists flooring in the same order shown in the catalog.
