Taro Tubers are a type of seed. Mature Plants yield Taro Roots.
Taro Tubers can be obtained from Common Chests or Magma Duggies in the Volcano Dungeon, from Seed Makers using Taro Roots, by breaking open Golden Coconuts, from the Island Trader for 2 Bone Fragments, from Lionfish Fish Ponds when the population reaches 4, or from Ginger Island artifact spots and panning.
Taro Tubers planted in most farm tiles take 10 days to mature with watering each day, as with other crops. However, Taro Tubers planted approximately within 3 tiles of a water source (such as a Farm Pond or a river) in any direction are considered to be irrigated. Paddies need not be continuous with each other or adjacent to water in order to count as irrigated. Irrigated Taro Tubers mature in 7 days and do not require watering.
