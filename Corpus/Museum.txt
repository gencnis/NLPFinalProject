Closed:

Town Festival days


Address:

East side of Pelican Town, south of the Blacksmith.


Occupants:

 Gunther


The Museum can be found in the South-East corner of Pelican Town, south of the Blacksmith.
The museum contains a library and a gallery for displaying the museum's collection. At the start of the game, the entire museum collection is empty. Gunther, the curator, will ask The Player to help by donating Artifacts and Minerals.
Only a single copy of any particular item may be donated. Note that if an item has not yet been donated, its description in inventory or storage says: "Gunther can tell you more about this if you donate it to the museum". Items can be rearranged in the donation interface, or by clicking the small paper on the left side of Gunther's desk at any time.  Donated items may be examined by right-clicking on them. 
Penny tutors Vincent and Jas in the library on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Achievements
There are 2 Achievements associated with donating Artifacts or Minerals to the Museum.

Treasure Trove (Donate 40 different items to the museum)
A Complete Collection (Complete the museum collection)
Villager Paths
 Villager Paths in the Museum
The Museum's main shelving area is quite busy but the area below that with the desks is safe for item placement (such as the three-part skeleton display).  
Note: The main artifact display area is safe until/unless JojaMart closes, at which time Sam will start working as a janitor there instead.  He walks through the central paths to sweep the back corner, but the display-areas furthest to the right are still safe.


Notes
There is a total of 102 spaces available for donations to be placed but a total of only 95 available items to be donated. Six spaces in the center of the largest table cannot be reached to examine items placed on them, so it may be advisable to leave this area empty.
If using a controller, any diagonal item may be unreachable for examination once donated.
To move items inside the donation interface on Switch, go to "Options" and disable "Use Controller Style Menus".
In iOS (and possibly other mobile versions) items on the bottom most row cannot be moved in the donation interface. However, if the character goes to the front desk one tile to the left of Gunther, they get the option to rearrange the collection (even without completing the collection). In this mode, all the items are moveable.
