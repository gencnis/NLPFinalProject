The Truffle is a type of mushroom that can only be spawned by a Pig on The Farm when the pig is outside the Barn. Since pigs do not go out of the barn in winter, they spawn no truffles in that season.  Truffles sell for a base price of 625g.
Despite being spawned by pigs, truffles are not considered to be animal produce, like eggs or milk. They do not receive a price increase from the Rancher profession.
Despite being mushrooms, Truffles technically are also not considered to be foraged items, but give Foraging EXP when picked up on the farm. They are not among the items included in the foraging category at the Stardew Valley Fair, nor are they labeled as "Forage" in inventory. They do, however, benefit from the Gatherer and Botanist professions.
Truffles not gathered on the 28th day of a season disappear on the following morning, the 1st day of the new season.
On rare occasions, a Truffle can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for 1,875-3,125g.
