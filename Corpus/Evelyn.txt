Relationships
Evelyn is married to George, and lives with her grandson Alex. Alex's deceased mother Clara was Evelyn's daughter.
In Evelyn's nightstand is a note written to her addressed as Momma. The note reads:




“

“Momma- If you're reading this, it means I've passed on. I'm so sorry you had to go through this. Know that I love you both.
Don't be too upset, I'm with Yoba now.
My final request: take care of Alex. He needs a family, something stable. He's a good kid.
Love,
Clara”



This is possibly a note from Evelyn's daughter, Clara, who is the mother of Alex. Clara passed away and left Alex to live with Evelyn and George.
In the beginning of Stardew Valley, when meeting all the townspeople, Evelyn will give you permission to call her "Granny".

Regular




“

“Oh my! What a lovely day.”

“Don't mind my husband, George. He isn't very friendly to strangers. If you get to know him better he'll warm up to you. I'm sure you two could become good friends one day!”





“

“George spends the whole day in front of that darned television set. I wish he'd go outside more. Some fresh air would do him good.”





“

“I used to love looking at the clouds, but I have trouble seeing them these days. My eyes just don't work as well as they used to.”





“

“It's nice to be so close to the ocean. The sound of the sea makes going to sleep a lot easier. As kids we hunted for seashells after the tide went out. Those were the days...”

If player marries Alex

“

“Oh, hello my dear. I think of you as my own grand-daughter/grandson now.”

“Hello, dear...
            I know you're just getting started as a gardener, so I wanted to give you a little tip.

-Granny Evelyn”
