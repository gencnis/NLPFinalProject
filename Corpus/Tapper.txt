This article is about the item. For the profession, see Skills#Foraging.
The Tapper is a type of Refining Equipment that can be placed on a tree to produce Maple Syrup, Oak Resin, Pine Tar, or Sap. It can also be placed on a Mushroom Tree to produce different mushrooms.
The Tapper can be removed from a tree by hitting it once with an axe or pickaxe. This leaves the Tapper intact and able to be reused. If the Tapper is on a tree when it is struck by lightning or hit by an exploding bomb, both the Tapper and its contents are destroyed.
During Winter, tappers placed on Maple Trees, Oak Trees, Pine Trees, or Mahogany Trees continue to produce; however since Mushroom Trees turn to stumps in Winter, tappers placed on them produce nothing during that season.
