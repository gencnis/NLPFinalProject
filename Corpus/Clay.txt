Bundles

Tailoring
Clay is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create a Shirt.  It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
Two, three, or five Clay may be requested by several fish in Fish Pond quests.

Tips
