 The sewing machine interface.
For instructions on how to dye clothing using the Sewing Machine or Dye Pots, see Dyeing.
Tailoring involves creating new shirts, pants, skirts, shorts, and hats at the sewing machine located inside Emily and Haley's house.  Boots and shoes can also be custom-tailored, which does not create a new item, but transfers the stats from one pair to another.
Tailoring and Dyeing are unlocked in a cutscene the day after the player acquires at least 1 Cloth. Emily will appear in front of the player's house and tell them that they can tailor clothes using the sewing machine at her house.
Each item requires Cloth in the feed and one other item on the spool.  Prismatic clothing is random, so Cloth + Prismatic Shard can produce any of the 5 prismatic clothing items (including duplicates).
Shirts, Pants, and Hats cannot be sold anywhere in Stardew Valley.  Boots/Shoes can be sold to the Adventurer's Guild.

Shirts
Shirts chosen at character creation at the start of the game are not dyeable.  Their corresponding tailored versions may be dyeable, after being created at the sewing machine.
The Oasis sells a random Shirt each day of the week for 1,000g.  Shirts that can be chosen at character creation but cannot be Tailored or obtained any other way may be sold at the Oasis.
Note that there are three shirts called "Bandana Shirt", none of which are dyeable.  The non-dyeable "Sailor Shirt" chosen at character creation is visually nearly identical to the dyeable "Sailor Shirt" that can be created with a variety of fish, and has a dyeable neckerchief.
For dyeable shirts that can be created with more than one item, the color depends on the item used to Tailor it.

There is a secret pants item that can be created after obtaining Mayor Lewis' Lucky Purple Shorts.



Details 


Placing the shorts in the feed and a Gold Bar on the spool will produce  Trimmed Lucky Purple Shorts. They can also be obtained by placing a Staircase in the player's pants slot. This will consume the full stack of staircases.  These can be used to fulfill the Mayor's "Shorts" quest, placed in the Luau soup or Grange Display at the Stardew Valley Fair, or they can be worn by the player for an amusing reaction from Marnie and Lewis.

The item on the spool will be consumed in the process.  The resulting item in the feed will be called "Custom-tailored [name of shoe/boot]".

Notes
Some items that cannot be used to tailor clothing will not be greyed out until cloth is placed in the feed.  Similarly, invalid tailoring items placed on the spool will cause cloth to be greyed out.
