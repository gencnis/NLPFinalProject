 Locations in the Backwoods where forageable items can spawn.
The Backwoods is an exterior region in the northwest part of Stardew Valley.  It consists of two disconnected sections.  The higher elevation section is a path connecting the Farm to the Mountain in an L-shaped curve.  The lower section (outlined in blue in the map) can only be reached by heading west along the road from the Bus Stop, and provides access to The Tunnel.

Foraging
Forageable items found on the ground in the Backwoods are:[1]

In Spring:  Leek (58%), and  Wild Horseradish (42%)
In Summer:  Grape (62%), and  Spice Berry (38%)
In Fall:  Hazelnut (53%),  Common Mushroom (24%), and  Wild Plum (24%)
In Winter:  Holly (43%),  Crocus (35%), and  Crystal Fruit (22%)
Forageable items spawn at an average rate of 0.4 per night in spring, summer, and fall; in winter the rate is 0.25 per night.[2] They spawn only in the higher-elevation section of the Backwoods. The map shows the possible locations as red and magenta tiles; when the original trees are present, the magenta tiles have a 90% smaller chance of spawning items because they are identified as being behind the original trees.
There are also numerous Salmonberry and Blackberry bushes in both sections of the Backwoods.

Artifact Spots
The only Artifact that can be found by digging up Artifact Spots in the Backwoods is:

 Skeletal Hand (4-8%[3])
Other possible items are:

1-3  Clay (18-39%[3])
 Lost Book (20% + 5-9%[3]); once all Lost Books have been found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by  Mixed Seeds.
Only in Winter:  Winter Root (24%)
Only in Winter:  Snow Yam (16%)
1-3  Stone (6-13%[3])
1-3  Copper Ore (3-7%[3])
Only in Spring: 2-5  Rice Shoots (5%)
1-3  Coal (2.4-5%[3])
An unseen  Secret Note: up to 3% chance, only if the player has a Magnifying Glass.
Artifact spots spawn only in the higher-elevation section of the Backwoods, at an average rate of 0.06 per night, except in winter when the average rate increases to 0.4 per night.[4]

Villager Paths
No villagers walk through the Backwoods, so items can be safely placed in any location.

Quests
 Linus' Blackberry Basket
After receiving Linus' letter and accepting the blackberry basket quest, the basket is located in the lower section of the Backwoods at the left side of the screen. Although it can be seen from the upper path, the basket can only be reached by exiting the Bus Stop to the west along the road.
The Backwoods is the scene of Abigail's 14-heart event.
