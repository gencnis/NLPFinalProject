The Barn is a type of farm building purchasable and upgradeable from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop. It takes three days to build and two days to upgrade.
The barn houses cows, goats, sheep, pigs, and ostriches.  Once you have unlocked an animal by building the barn needed to house it, that animal can be placed in any other non-upgraded barns you have built as well.
The total cost of a Deluxe Barn, built from scratch, is 43,000g  Wood (1350)  Stone (650) (Or, if all wood and stone are bought from Robin during year 1, 69,500g, and 175,500g if bought in year 2+.)
Barn Animals may be stuck outside at night if the barn doors are closed.  The conditions for this are not clear (see Animals trapped outside).  If an animal is stuck outside the barn at night, the next day their mood will be "grumpy."  Animals stuck outside are also subject to Wild Animal Attacks.
