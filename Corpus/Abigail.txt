“

“Abigail lives at the general store with her parents. She sometimes fights with her mom, who worries about Abigail’s “alternative lifestyle”. Her mom has the following to say: “I wish Abby would dress more appropriately and stop dyeing her hair blue. She has such a wonderful natural hair color, just like her grandmother did. Oh, and I wish she’d find some wholesome interests instead of this occult nonsense she’s into.” You might find Abigail alone in the graveyard, or maybe out in a rainstorm looking for frogs.”


— Dev Update #12


Abigail is a villager who lives at Pierre's General Store in Pelican Town. She is one of the twelve characters available to marry.

Heart Events
Two Hearts

Enter Pierre's General Store when Abigail is there, any day except Saturday.



Details 


You enter Abigail's room and watch her get angry about a videogame. She asks for your help, and you play the console version of Journey of the Prairie King together. (This is just like the arcade version in The Stardrop Saloon, except that Abigail plays a second character and actively helps you). When you finish the level, she thanks you and the cutscene ends. If you fail, however, she will still thank you for trying.
You can't gain or lose friendship points during this heart event.


Four Hearts

Visit the mountain between noon and 7pm on a rainy day, any season except Winter.



Details 


You see Abigail playing her flute. She asks what you're doing out in the rain.
"Just doing some work." (No effect on friendship.)
"Enjoying the weather." (+50 friendship.)
"I could ask you the same question." (+10 friendship.)
Regardless of your response, she invites you to stand under the tree with her. You pull out a harp and you play a duet as the camera pans out over the lake.


Six Hearts

Between 9pm and midnight on a day when it is not raining, enter Pelican Town from any direction.  (This includes exiting homes or shops in Town.)



Details 


Abigail is in the graveyard. She tells you that she's been practicing with her sword because she wants to go on adventures. She asks if you've ever used a sword.
"Yes, and it's exciting!" (+10 friendship.)
"Yes, but only in self-defense." (+10 friendship.)
"Yes, but it's dangerous. You should stay safe." (-100 friendship.)
"No." (No effect on friendship.)
Pierre arrives and interrupts to say that Caroline wants her to come help cook dinner. Abigail gets angry, saying they only expect her to help cook because she's a girl. She flees, calling for you to follow. You both hide in some bushes and talk. After talking she will ask you to help her untangle her hair from the bush, and the cutscene ends.


Eight Hearts

After receiving a letter from Abigail, enter Pierre's General Store between 8pm and 10pm when she's there. (Note that you cannot enter the store from outside after 9pm, but you can wait in Caroline's greenhouse and trigger the event by exiting to the kitchen.)



Details 


Abigail sends you a letter (signed "Abby") inviting you to visit her in her room. When you arrive, Abigail shows you her spirit board. It reveals a message that indicates she's starting to develop feelings for you. She gets embarrassed and rushes you out of her room. Regardless of how you entered the store, you will end up outside. The next day she visits you in the morning and apologizes.

Ten Hearts

After you give Abigail a Bouquet, enter the mines or the Quarry Mine between 5pm and midnight. The event won't trigger if you've already given her the Mermaid's Pendant.



Details 


Abigail is preparing to go down the ladder into the mine when she's startled by a bat flying up into her face. She laughs it off and looks back down the hole. Hundreds more bats fly up and she's terrified, running to cower in the corner of the cave. You rush in to comfort her.
"What happened?" (+20 friendship.)
"Are you okay?" (+40 friendship.)
She tells you that maybe she isn't as tough as she thought.

"You're safe with me." (+20 friendship.)
"I get scared too." (+40 friendship.)
"You're crying like a little baby. Stop." (-50 friendship.)
She confesses that she likes you as more than a friend, and asks you to stay with her there. She hugs you. If your character is a girl, she will also state that she didn't know she liked other girls until she met you.


After the 10-Heart Event
After viewing Abigail's 10-heart event, she will appear in The Mines on level 20 on days when it is raining.  She will not appear in a Multiplayer game, only in single-player mode.
The first time the player encounters Abigail in the Mines, she has unique dialogue.  Thereafter, there is a 15% chance to find her playing the flute, and an 85% chance of finding her walking in place.  If she is not playing the flute, she will speak to the player.

Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelorettes, raised friendship with each bachelorette to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelorette's 10-heart event, then entering Haley/Emily's House will trigger a cutscene. If Haley is the final bachelorette you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a gossip session about Mayor Lewis and Marnie's relationship.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelorettes will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelorettes will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelorettes will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Enter the Backwoods between 6:10am and 5pm.



Details 


The player is foraging in bushes as a monster appears from a bush. It attacks the player and the player collapses. Abigail appears and kills the monster. She asks if the player is okay and says "I've never taken a life before."
 Monster Grave
It's sad, but there was no other option. (No effect on friendship.)
Abigail responds "Yeah... I did what I had to do. I guess the world's a pretty tough place. It was either you or him, right?"

Monsters don't deserve our sympathy! (No effect on friendship.)
Abigail responds "...Aren't they just trying to survive, like us? They may be our enemies, but I still think they deserve sympathy. Still... I did what had to be done."

It's a harsh world, kid. (No effect on friendship.)
Abigail responds "Huh? That's pretty funny coming from someone who just got rescued... But... yeah... Sometimes reality forces us to do things we'd rather not... Guess I'm learning that the hard way."

Did you have to kill him? (No effect on friendship.)
Abigail responds "Hey! I saved your life, didn't I? Maybe you should think about that instead of putting me on a guilt trip."
Abigail warns the player to be more careful in the future, saying "I don't want to lose you."  Then, she buries the monster and marks the grave with the symbol of Yoba. 
Interacting with the grave displays the text: "Abigail took a life to save mine...I'll never forget that."
If you go home and talk to Abigail the same day as the event she'll say: "Good thing I brought my sword today!"


Marriage
Main article: Marriage
Once married, Abigail will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, she will add her own room to the right of the bedroom. She'll also set up a small area behind the farmhouse where she'll sometimes go to practice her flute.
On rainy days, Abigail may offer you Solar Essence, Bat Wing, Void Essence, Amethyst, or Fire Quartz.  On rainy nights, she may offer you soup:  Parsnip Soup, Tom Kha Soup, Trout Soup, Chowder, or Lobster Bisque.  On days when Abigail stays inside the farmhouse all day, she may offer you a Cherry Bomb, a Bomb, Fried Mushroom, or Crab Cakes to assist with your adventuring in the mines.

“I need to stretch my legs and get some fresh air today.”





“

“I try to help out in the shop on most days. Business has been pretty bad since the Joja Mart opened, though.”





“

“I can't wait to see some pumpkins this year. The spirit's eve festival happens at the end of the season. It's pretty low-key compared to what you'd see in Zuzu City, but for a small town like this it's a lot of fun.”





“

“Last night, I dreamt that my left hand had turned into a gigantic [random object]... Does that mean anything?”





“

“Do you have any scarecrows on your farm?”





“

“Are you growing pumpkins on your farm this year? Save one for me!”





“

“I may fight with my parents a lot, but I know they're just looking out for me. They're doing what they think is best. I dunno why I'm saying this to you. Don't tell anyone.”


If Joja has closed:




“

“Ever since Joja Mart shut down we've been doing great at the shop!”


If Community Center is restored:




“

“I can't believe you fixed up that old Community Center all by yourself. I'm really impressed.”


6+ Hearts

“Hi. Your hair looks cool today... did you do something different?”

“

“You know, I could actually see myself becoming a farmer some day... But how would that ever happen? *chuckle*”


Winter




“

“Well, fall is over... But I like winter, too!”





“

“It's just too cold to go outside much. But I do enjoy building a snowgoon.”





“

“Doesn't a steaming hot cup of cocoa sound good right now?”





“

“Hi. Is it boring to be a farmer during the winter?”





“

“It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year.”





“

“Another year is almost over. It goes by so fast, doesn't it?”





“

“One thing I've learned living here... everyone stares at you if you look different.”





“

“It's the weekend! That means I can play twice as many video games. Bye.”

“

“I've been daydreaming a lot lately... Oh! You want to know what it's about? Well... ...It's a secret.”

At Ginger Island




“

“I hope a mermaid visits the beach.”





“

“Bummer... Willy says we have to stay on the beach... And I brought my sword and everything...”





“

“The beach is okay, but it gets boring pretty quick. I'd rather check out that dark jungle, or the volcano!”





“

“Hmm, you think I could sneak my guinea pig onto the island? Nah, David's probably not much of a swimmer anyways.”





“

“My skin gets burnt really easily. So I'm just gonna stay under this umbrella for a while. I like it in the shade. Too much sun makes me dizzy.”





“

“Hey [Player], want to build a sand castle with me? Actually, a sand dungeon might be cooler!”





“

“Hey [Player], you think you could build a raft? I saw a few cool islands on the way here I want to visit.”





“

“An island this big has got to be hiding some buried treasure. Quick, get me a shovel! Relax, I'm just kidding.”





“

“Gus made me a dark purple refresher, to match my hair. It tastes great!”





“

“I'm gonna ask Willy if we can take the scenic route back.”





“

“Maybe we'll see a sea monster on the way back.”


Dating / 10 Hearts




“

“Hi. Do you feel like everything seems unreal lately? Not in a bad way, though.”





“

“I usually feel lonely this time of year, but not anymore. [Player], what are your plans for the future?”





“

“[Player], there's something I want to tell you...
It's just... um... well... your boots! They, uh...look really clean... *gulp*
That's all... *sigh*”






“

“Another year is almost over... But this was a really good year, don't you think?”





“

“Wow, you look nice today. I mean, that summer air is really good for the complexion, isn't it?... heh...”





“

“Do you ever get lonely on your farm?”





“

“I had an interesting dream last night, with you in it. It was a good dream.”

Trivia
When Abigail was first revealed during early development she was depicted with dyed blue hair. This was later changed to purple.
Abigail wishes she had a cat but her Dad is "allergic to pretty much everything."
Giving her something she likes will result in her implying that she is going to eat the gift, regardless of what it is. This includes diamond, an item that is the hardest mineral on the Moh's hardness scale.
Despite playing the flute, she dislikes being given the Bone Flute as a gift.
Abigail has a pet guinea pig named "David." If Abigail moves in with the player, another guinea pig named "David Jr." will be present in her farmhouse room, while "David" stays behind in her original room at Pierre's General Store.
Despite loving Blackberry Cobbler, she dislikes blackberries.
After a sufficient relationship is built up, Pierre will confess that he worries that Abigail is not his biological daughter. Later, the Wizard will mention that he has reason to believe one of the townsfolk is his daughter. At one point Caroline will mention that she used to take secret walks to the Wizard’s tower. Abigail will also stand outside the Wizard’s Tower sometimes. However, some of Caroline's dialogue also reveals that Abigail's natural hair colour is a light brown, as opposed to the purple colour she dyes it.
Abigail has a poster of Crono hanging above her TV; Crono is a character from the Super Nintendo game "Chrono Trigger."
Abigail's video game console looks like a Super Nintendo.
Abigail mentions that the player owns an electric blanket, if married to her.
If you try to look in the dresser in her room while she is in the room or in her parents’ room, she says the following: “Hey, don’t even think about it! That’s private!”
Abigail has a bow in her hair on her sprite, but no bow is shown on her Portraits. This bow can, however, be seen in early versions of her Portrait.
Despite Abigail saying a vacation on the beach would get old fast, she visits the beach resort on Ginger Island very frequently after the player repairs it.
If you win the game during Abigail's two heart event, she will comment on your ability to use a joystick. The dialogue changes depending on the gender of the player, however, the way she says it appears particularly lewd, and the accompanying smile reinforces the idea of a lewd joke. If the player is male, Abigail will say "Thanks, [player name]. You seem to really know your way around a joystick, huh? I guess that makes sense". If the player is female, she will say "Thanks, [player name]. I didn't think you'd know how to work a joystick so well! But it seems you're experienced."
After the 10 heart cutscene, during rainy days in floor 20 of the mines, Abigail will say [player name] (85% chance), which is helpful when using the item ID glitch. Floor 20 can be exited and reentered repeatedly, with an 85% chance of Abigail saying [player name] each time.
History

1.1: Added flute practice area behind farmhouse if married.
1.3.27: Added appearance in the mines after viewing 10-heart event.  Added group 10-heart event.
