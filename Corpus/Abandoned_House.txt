Abandoned House








Open Hours:

All Day


Closed:

Never


Address:

Cindersap Forest


Occupants:

 Hat Mouse


The Abandoned House (also called the "Ruined House" on the in-game map) is a house located in the south of Cindersap Forest. A mouse takes over the building and opens a shop there selling hats to the player as soon as the first achievement is earned. All hats cost 1,000g.
Hats are purely cosmetic. A new hat will appear in the shop whenever an achievement is earned.  Hats won at the Egg Festival and Festival of Ice will also appear in the hat shop, once it is unlocked.

Letter
A letter is sent in the mail the day after the first achievement is earned, which notifies the player that the hat shop is open.  The hat shop can be visited without reading the letter, however.
