The Horse Flute is an item that warps a player's horse to them. As a horse is required for this item, the player must have a Stable.
It's purchasable from Mr. Qi's shop in Qi's Walnut Room, for 50 Qi Gems.
It only works outdoors while no other players are currently riding the horse (if in Multiplayer) and can be used to summon the horse to Ginger Island and to the Desert.
The Horse Flute will not work until the horse is named, even if the stable is already built.
