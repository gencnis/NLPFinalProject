 For crafted decorative items, see Crafting.
See also: Wallpaper, Flooring
Furniture can be purchased from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop or from the Traveling Cart merchant. Both shops offer a random selection of furniture each day they are open. The cost of furniture at the Traveling Cart is random, but is always between 250-2,500g. Prices at the Carpenter's Shop do not vary.
Some furniture can be obtained only by donating items to the Museum, purchased at Festivals, the Casino, JojaMart, or other unique sources. These exceptions are listed in the tables below.
After the first Farmhouse upgrade, Robin also offers the Furniture Catalogue for sale at the Carpenter's Shop. Once placed, "using" the furniture catalogue allows you to purchase furniture items for 0g in unlimited quantity.
Most furniture can be placed outside.[1] However, some items cannot be placed anywhere other than inside the Farmhouse or a Shed. Furniture will display a green square on tiles where it can be placed. The tile will turn red if the furniture cannot be placed. Note: Items placed outside the farm will be destroyed if a villager walks through the square where it is placed. The Crafting page shows player-created maps that indicate which tiles are safe from villager-pathing.
Players can sit in chairs, benches, couches, and armchairs.
Furniture cannot be sold through the Shipping Bin or to any merchant/shop.

Controls
Computer:  Right-click on furniture while selected to rotate or place it, depending on the item. Some furniture can be easily picked up and moved by  left-clicking; other furniture requires the player to use a tool or to hold left-click to remove it once it is placed.
Nintendo Switch: Use the  A button to rotate furniture.
Chairs
The Crystal Chair cannot be purchased; it can be obtained only from donating 41 Minerals to the Museum.
The Tropical Chair is only available from the Island Trader for 1 Lionfish.
All other chairs listed below can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for 250-2,500g, or from the Furniture Catalogue for 0g.
