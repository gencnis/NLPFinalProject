 Cindersap Forest during Spring
Cindersap Forest is a large exterior region found in the southwest part of Stardew Valley. It has exits to the north into the Farm, to the east into Pelican Town, to the south into The Sewers, and to the northwest into the Secret Woods.  Cindersap Forest is the only place where Spring Onions are found.
Two festivals take place in Cindersap Forest: the Flower Dance on Spring 24, and the Festival of Ice on Winter 8.
At the start of the game, there are many twigs, rocks, and weeds throughout the forest. If cleaned up, the debris will reappear each Spring 1.

The Secret Woods is the area adjacent to the northwest corner of the forest.  To enter, first remove a Large Log found in Cindersap Forest, possible once the Steel Axe upgrade has been done.






Traveling Cart

Trash Bear
 Trash Bear
The Trash Bear is located at the bottom of Cindersap Forest, by the Spring Onion patch and the entrance to The Sewers.  Trash Bear will appear on non-rainy days beginning year 3.  Interacting with Trash Bear will show a dialogue bubble of a random desired item.  After giving Trash Bear the requested item, clicking on Trash Bear will reveal another request.  Fulfilling four requests will trigger a cutscene in which Trash Bear plays pan-pipes, flies up on an umbrella made of leaves, and then cleans up the trash in the unreachable area near the water, replacing the trash with bushes and trees.  Trash Bear continues flying on the umbrella to Pelican Town, where the trash in Pam's front yard is removed.  Dusty's dog pen also gets an upgrade.
Trash Bear will request 2 random seasonal fish or foraged items, then 2 cooked dishes.  There is no time limit in fulfilling these requests. Note, however, that requests will not be able to be fulfilled on rainy days as Trash Bear does not appear on those days.  A request will never change until it is completed, unless the season changes and the previous request was seasonal. In this case, Trash Bear's request will change to fit the new season. Shown below is a complete list of the random seasonal items Trash Bear may request:

Foraging
 Locations in Cindersap Forest where forageable items can spawn.
Standard forageable items found on the ground in Cindersap Forest are:[1]

In Spring:  Wild Horseradish (50%), and  Dandelion (50%)
In Summer:  Sweet Pea (60%), and  Spice Berry (40%)
In Fall:  Common Mushroom (50%), and  Blackberry (50%)
In Winter:  Crocus (39%),  Crystal Fruit (39%), and  Holly (22%)
Forageable items spawn at an average rate of 1.8 per night in spring and fall; in summer and winter the rate is 1.6 per night.[2] The map shows the possible locations as red and magenta tiles; when the original trees are present, the magenta tiles have a 90% smaller chance of spawning items because they are identified as being behind the original trees.
Spring Onions are also found in Cindersap Forest during the Spring.  They appear only on tillable soil on the large southeastern island (the green tiles on the map).  Every night, any existing onions are removed, and new onions spawn.  These onions are not standard forageable items, and therefore do not count as part of the six item per map limit. 
The forest also contains a large variety of Trees, which can be chopped down to harvest Wood and other items.  As with all pre-existing trees outside the Farm, they will automatically regrow as long as the stump is removed.

Artifact Spots
Artifacts that can be found by digging up Artifact Spots in Cindersap Forest are:

 Palm Fossil (0.6% + 3-5%[3])
 Prehistoric Scapula (3-6%[3])
 Prehistoric Handaxe (3%)
 Ancient Doll (2.4%)
 Prehistoric Tool (2.1%)
 Trilobite (1.9%)

 Ancient Drum (0.7%)
 Bone Flute (0.7%)

 Ancient Sword (0.7%)
 Ornamental Fan (0.7%)
 Prehistoric Tibia (0.6%)
 Amphibian Fossil (0.6%)
 Strange Doll (green) (0.06%)
 Strange Doll (yellow) (0.06%)
Other possible items are:

1-3  Clay (14-29%[3])
 Lost Book (20% + 3-7%[3]); once all Lost Books have been found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by  Mixed Seeds.
Only in Winter:  Winter Root (18%)
Only in Winter:  Snow Yam (12%)
1-3  Stone (5-10%[3])
1-3  Copper Ore (2.4-5%[3])
Only in Spring: 2-5  Rice Shoots (4%)
An unseen  Secret Note: up to 3% chance, only if the player has a Magnifying Glass.
Artifact spots spawn at an average rate of 0.1 per night, except in winter when the average rate increases to 1.0 per night.[4]

Villager Paths
 Villager Paths in Cindersap Forest
Several villagers walk through northern section of the Forest at various times, so items may be destroyed.  However, items placed in the southern half of the forest are always safe.


Fishing
 Fishing Zones in the Cindersap Forest river.
Cindersap Forest is the only map with different bodies of water that contain different fish: the river and the pond.
Fishing is also part of the festivities during the Festival of Ice.
The forest is bordered to the south by the ocean. While it is possible to cast a fishing rod from the cliffs down to the ocean (near the bridge that leads to the area where the Flower Dance takes place), only river fish can be caught there, not ocean fish.

River
The primary fishing location in Cindersap Forest is the river flowing through it. It is an extension of the river found in Pelican Town, and therefore contains mostly the same river fish.  Two fish, Chub and Dorado, are found in the forest river but not in town; the Smallmouth Bass is found in town but not in the forest river (it is, however, found in the forest pond).  Also, the forest river is home in Winter to a Legendary Fish, the Glacierfish, as well as the Glacierfish Jr., one of the legendary fish II.


Pond
 Fishing Zones in the Cindersap Forest pond.
The second body of water for fishing in Cindersap Forest is the large pond in its northwest corner. Its selection of fish is more limited than the river (Carp, Catfish, Midnight Carp, Perch, Pike, Smallmouth Bass, and Walleye, dependent on season).
