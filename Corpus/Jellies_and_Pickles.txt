 For a detailed analysis of profit using the Preserves Jar, see Preserves Jar Productivity.
Jellies and pickles can be produced by inserting either a fruit or a vegetable in a preserves jar, respectively. The value of a single jar of jelly or pickles is equal to (2 * Base Crop Value + 50).  Jelly and pickles are unaffected by the quality of the fruit or vegetable used.
A preserves jar requires 4000 minutes, or 2-3 days, to produce pickles or jelly. [1]

Products
Quality of ingredients makes no difference to the finished product. The value of the finished product is determined using the base value (i.e., with no silver or gold star) of the fruit/vegetable. However, the preserved version is always more profitable than even gold star produce, although the profit margin is lower compared to normal produce.
