Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG. You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!

Summary


2012–2016(1.0–1.2.33)

The game was developed entirely by ConcernedApe (Eric Barone) up to Stardew Valley 1.2.33, including all art, sound effects, and music. The game is programmed in C# using the Microsoft XNA framework (on Windows) and MonoGame (on Linux and macOS). The art was drawn using Paint.NET, and the game's music and sound effects were composed in Propellerhead Software's Reason. It took four years for ConcernedApe to develop the first public release, during which he posted development updates on stardewvalley.blogspot.com (2012-2013) and the game's official website (2013-present). It was released to the public on February 26th, 2016.


2018–2019(1.3–1.3.36)

For Stardew Valley 1.3, ConcernedApe focused on the gameplay and content changes while Tom Coxon (then at Chucklefish) developed the multiplayer code.


2019–2020(1.4–1.4.5)

In early 2019, ConcernedApe formed a small development team to continue updating the game. Version 1.4 was developed by ConcernedApe, Arthur Lee (a.k.a. Mr. Podunkian), and Alex Erlandson (a.k.a. zillix).


2020–2021(1.5–1.5.6)

Version 1.5 was developed by ConcernedApe and Arthur Lee (a.k.a. Mr. Podunkian).

The official updates on PC are ported to other platforms by specialized porting companies, specifically The Secret Police for mobile and Sickhead Games for console.
