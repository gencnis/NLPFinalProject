Behavior
Their behavior is similar to that of Bats and Serpents; they may fly away from the player and change the direction of attack.
They have 2 methods of appearing:

They can be regular enemies on the floor. Approaching them makes them active and they will attack the player from this point on.
They can appear at random. They will screech and then one will approach from a random direction outside the level.
Strategy
The best weapon may be a regular sword swing (not a club or dagger), since its angle is large.  If possible, move in a contrary direction to the Skull so a mob is all on one side of the player, and swing at them all at once.
