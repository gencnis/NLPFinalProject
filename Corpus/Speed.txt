 Player Speed
The player's base speed is:

2 when walking
5 when running
6.6 when riding a Horse
A variety of positive and negative Buffs can change the player speed, as detailed under Food and Drink and Buffs. In theory, five speed-related buffs could be simultaneously active, three positive (maximum +4 Speed) and two negative (minimum -5 Speed).
Finally, speed is also affected by some terrains, but not when riding a horse.
Although terrain and/or debuffs may decrease a player speed, the speed is never decreased below 1.

Food and Drink
The following foods and drinks increase Player Speed. Only one drink-derived buff and one food-derived buff can be active at a given time, so +2 Speed is possible only if the +1 Speed from a drink (Coffee and Triple Shot Espresso) is stacked with the +1 Speed from one of the food items.
Coffee is available at The Stardrop Saloon every day for 300g, but the other dishes may appear only randomly on Gus' menu.
