The Cabin is a farm building that enables the ability to house one farmhand each in a Multiplayer game.
They behave much like the Farmhouse, but belong to a farmhand rather than the host of the game. Up to 3 cabins can be present. They may be chosen at the start of a new co-op game, in "Nearby" or "Separate" layout, or can also be added to a saved game by visiting the Carpenter's Shop and choosing "Construct farm building" from the menu. If chosen at the start of a Multiplayer game, cabins are free.  If built on an existing farm, the cost is 100g for each of the 3 varieties of Cabin, plus the building materials listed in the table below.  Cabins are built instantaneously upon purchase.
A farmhand moves into a cabin by picking up the Parsnip Seeds left by Mayor Lewis on the floor of the cabin.
Cabins can be demolished by the host at any time, by visiting the Carpenter's Shop (or Wizard's Tower, if the player has unlocked the magic buildings).  This will permanently remove the player who occupies the cabin from the game.  The player's inventory (other than tools) will appear in a chest in place of the demolished cabin.
A farmhand's inventory can be accessed by the host player in a Multiplayer game by looking in Mayor Lewis' Manor in the Lost and Found box.

Interior
The interior of a cabin is identical to that of the main Farmhouse. It is possible for farmhands to sleep in other cabins that are not considered to be their own, although they will be the only ones able to move their own bed.

Upgrades
Much like upgrading the Farmhouse, each farmhand can upgrade their cabin three times at the Carpenter's Shop. The process is identical, taking place through the same dialogue, with each upgrade having the same cost as the equivalent farmhouse upgrade and taking 3 days to complete.  Individual cabin upgrades are independent to any other farmhand's housing, and Farmhands can only upgrade their own housing. There is no option to upgrade any other cabin (or the main Farmhouse) on the behalf of others.

Varieties
The game automatically chooses the style and location of cabins, if cabins are chosen at the start of a new game.  If purchased from the Carpenter's Shop, the player can choose which style to build, and where to place them. 
Preset locations of cabins can be found at Cabin Locations.
