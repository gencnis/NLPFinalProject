The location and appearance of the decorations and any stationary animals placed inside is random and can be changed without removing items by picking up and re-placing the tank.

Animations
Most of the swimming creatures either move around without animating (e.g., Pufferfish, Octopus) or move their tails / rear parts of their bodies at various speeds while swimming. However, some of the swimming creatures have unique animations:

Eels and Lava Eels undulate up and down like a dolphin or whale (rather than side to side like an eel or other fish).
Squids and Midnight Squids push with their tentacles much like the Blue Squid found in the mines with the Shrine of Challenge active.
Stingrays flip their fins up and down as well as moving their tails.

Details
