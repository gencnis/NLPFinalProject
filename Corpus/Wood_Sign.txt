The Wood Sign is a craftable item that can display the image of any item that can be held in inventory.  An image can be placed on the sign by holding an item in inventory and right-clicking on the sign.  The item will not be consumed.
Wood Signs can be placed anywhere in Stardew Valley, indoors or outdoors.  If placed in a villager's path, the sign will be destroyed.  See "Crafted goods outside the farm" for maps of areas safe from villager pathing.
Placing a Wood Sign on a Fish Pond will turn it into a counter of how many fish are inside, with an image of the fish visible on the sign, and the number of fish in the pond in the lower right corner.
