This article is about the artifact. For the fruit seed, see Ancient Seeds.
The Ancient Seed is an Artifact that can be found by digging up an Artifact Spot in Cindersap Forest or The Mountain (including the Quarry), or obtained inside Fishing Treasure Chests after reaching Fishing level 2 and Artifact Troves. It can also be dropped from Bugs, Grubs, Cave Flies, Mutant Flies, and Mutant Grubs (0.5% chance) or found by cutting down foliage in Prehistoric Floors. Placing a packet of  Ancient Seeds in a Deconstructor yields an Ancient Seed.
This artifact can be crafted into viable seeds that can be planted to grow Ancient Fruit during Spring, Summer and Fall, or during any season in the Greenhouse or the Ginger Island farm.
