Stone is a basic resource obtained by mining rocks with a pickaxe.  Stone can also be purchased from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop, or found in Fishing Treasure Chests.  Stone Golems and Gray Slimes also drop Stone.  Fifty stones can also be received as a gift from Robin at the Feast of the Winter Star.  Stone may also be obtained by digging up an Artifact Spot.  A Stonefish Fish Pond may produce 30 Stone when the population reaches 9. Stone can also be acquired by fishing in the fountain left of the Community Center.
Normal rocks yield between 1 and 3 stones. Boulders yield 10 stones. 
Stone is used in various crafting recipes and is also required as a form of payment when purchasing certain buildings and building upgrades at the Carpenter's Shop.  The Desert Trader will sell 1 Fiber in exchange for 5 Stone on Tuesdays.
