This article is about the category of items. For the specific item, see Trash (item).
Trash is a category of items in Stardew Valley. With the exception of the Rotten Plant, these items have a chance to be collected when fishing, or obtained from Garbage Cans. All except for Joja Cola and the Rotten Plant can be collected from Crab Pots. Trash is the less favorable alternative when fishing, as fish are worth more to sell and have far more uses. However, trash items (other than Joja Cola and the Rotten Plant) can be used in a Recycling Machine to create more useful materials.
A random trash item is caught while fishing, after failing skill checks to get a bite ("hit") from every type of fish and other catchables currently available at a location. More types of fish currently available at a location generally results in a greater chance of a bite, which results in a decreased chance of catching trash. Trash is therefore much more common when fishing in locations with few types of fish and rarer fish, such as The Mines, and trash is the only possible result when fishing in the Farm Pond on a Standard Farm.
The likelihood of catching trash at most locations will also decrease substantially as fishing skill increases. At fishing level 10, trash frequency can decrease by over 20 percentage points if few types of fish are present, and trash frequency approaches 0% when at least 5 types of fish (including algae and seaweed) are present.[1]
Catching Trash with a fishing pole grants 3 Fishing XP. Harvesting Trash from a Crab Pot grants 5 Fishing XP. In the fishing minigame at the Stardew Valley Fair, trash items are worth one point.
The Rotten Plant can be obtained by a Jack-O-Lantern which becomes a Rotten Plant when standing outside in Winter. It can also be found as a part of a secret.
