 The Shrine of Illusions
The Shrine of Illusions is an altar found in the basement of the Wizard's Tower. The player can offer 500g to the shrine to change their appearance, name, favorite thing, gender, as well as the appearance (but not type) of their pet.
The Wizard's basement becomes accessible when the Player has at least four hearts with him. It can also be accessed through a red portal in the Witch's Hut.

Trivia
Changing the character's name to include item spawn codes triggers an Easter egg.
Changing the favorite thing to be "ConcernedApe" or anything containing "Stardew" gives special dialogue when collecting a stardrop.
History
1.4: Added ability to change pet appearance. Removed shirts and pants color sliders in favor of Tailoring system.
1.5: The player can now also change their gender, name, and favorite thing.
