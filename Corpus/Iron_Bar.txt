Ingredients:

 Iron Ore (5) Coal (1)


An Iron Bar is created by smelting 5 Iron Ore in a furnace with 1 coal for fuel, or by Crafting the "Transmute (Fe)" recipe (3 Copper Bars into one Iron Bar which is unlocked at mining level 4).  
Iron Bars may occasionally be found in Garbage Cans after receiving the Furnace blueprints from Clint.  An Iron Bar may also drop from a Shadow Brute (2% chance) or Shadow Shaman (2% chance) when slain.
Smelting iron ore in a furnace takes 2 in-game hours.  The "Transmute (Fe)" recipe is earned at Mining Level 4.
Iron bars are used in a variety of crafting recipes and are used to upgrade tools to tier 3. Each iron bar can be sold for 120g, or 180g with the Blacksmith Profession.
