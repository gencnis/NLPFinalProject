The Scythe is a tool used to cut grass, weeds, and young trees, and is also required for harvesting certain crops (i.e., Amaranth, Kale, Wheat).  It is in the player's inventory at the start of the game.
If the player has a Silo, cutting each plot of Grass growing on the Farm gives a 50% chance of adding a piece of hay to the silo.
A Scythe may be used as a weapon to inflict a small amount of damage.  Using a Scythe does not consume energy. 
If it is lost (by dying in the Mines, for example), a new one should spawn the next morning, either next to the bed or in the refrigerator.
A more powerful scythe called the Golden Scythe can be found once the Quarry is unlocked.
