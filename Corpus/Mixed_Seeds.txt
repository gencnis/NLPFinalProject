Mixed Seeds are a random type of seed capable of producing a specific set of crops (listed below). The crop that will grow from a Mixed Seed is decided when it is planted. Mixed Seeds collected in any season always grow to become crops of the season in which they are planted, including those planted in the Greenhouse and indoors via the Garden Pot. Mixed Seeds cannot be planted in winter except in the Greenhouse and indoors in garden pots, where they become one of the random crops from any season. Mixed Seeds planted on Ginger Island are always the same no matter the season.
