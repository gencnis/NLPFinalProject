The Seed Maker is a piece of Refining Equipment that produces seeds from a harvested crop or one of four foraged items: Wild Horseradish, Spice Berry, Common Mushroom, or Winter Root. It takes  20m to process seeds. [1]
A Seed Maker can be crafted after reaching Farming Level 9.  One Seed Maker is the reward for completing the  Dye Bundle on the Bulletin Board. A Seed Maker may occasionally be found in a treasure room in the Skull Cavern.

Seeds per Crop
The Seed Maker can produce 1-3 seeds of the same variety as the input crop (97.51% chance, average of 2 seeds), 1-4 Mixed Seeds (1.99% chance), or 1 packet of Ancient Seeds (0.5% chance).
To avoid buying new seeds, an average of 51% of harvests would need to be sacrificed (= 1 / (0.9751 * 2)) to obtain new seeds for the next growing cycle.
The game creates a pseudo-random number to determine the type and number of seeds produced. Note that Luck does not have any effect:
(# days played) + (unique game ID) / 2 + (X tileLocation of Seed Maker) + (Y tileLocation of Seed Maker) × 77 + (timeOfDay) [1]
