Iridium Crabs are an enemy found in the Skull Cavern, starting at level 26.  When killed, they may drop Crab Cakes and up to 3 Iridium Ore.  They may also very rarely drop a Diamond or Prismatic Shard when killed. 60 rock crabs (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

Behavior
They disguise themselves as Iridium Nodes, sometimes surprising the player. When immobile, they are invulnerable to attack, though they can be hit with a pickaxe to knock them back, making them mobile again.

Strategy
Iridium Crabs may be differentiated from Iridium Nodes by striking them with a Sword.  An Iridium Crab will make a knocking sound and a zero damage indicator will pop up when hit with a sword, while an Iridium Node will not.
The Iridium Crab can only be dealt damage if it is mobile, and not hiding beneath its shell.  Strike an immobile Iridium Crab with the pickaxe to make it mobile again.
Striking an Iridium Crab with a pickaxe enough times will knock the shell off of its back, and will cause it to flee. Alternatively, setting off a bomb near an Iridium Crab can remove its shell, and will cause it to flee as well.  A Mega Bomb is particularly effective at removing Iridium Crab shells.
