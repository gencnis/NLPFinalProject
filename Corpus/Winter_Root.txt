The Winter Root is a foraging item found only in Winter. Wild winter roots do not grow above ground, but instead they are buried in the snow/dirt and must be dug up with a Hoe (no other tools, even Bombs, will work).
The highest chance of finding a Winter Root (17-24%, map-dependent) is when digging up an Artifact Spot.[1]  There is also a 4% chance of finding a Winter Root when digging standard tillable soil in any exterior location.[2]  Exceptions are in the Farm, where Winter Roots can be found at artifact spots, but not standard tillable soil, and in the Desert, where Winter Roots can not be found at all.  Digging up a Winter Root provides no experience.
Winter Roots can also be grown from Winter Seeds, in which case they are a standard wild-seed crop: they grow above ground, can be harvested without using a tool, give 7 Foraging XP each, and are affected by the Gatherer and Botanist professions.
Occasionally they may be sold at the Traveling Cart or found in Garbage Cans in Winter.  They may also be dropped by Blue Slimes (8% chance) in The Mines (floors 40-80) or Secret Woods.
Putting a Winter Root in a Seed Maker will generate 1-3 Winter Seeds.

↑ The chance of appearing in an artifact spot is calculated by GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot.  The base chance in code is 30% (0.5*0.6), but the actual chance is lower because artifacts and lost books are checked first and must all fail their checks.

↑ The chance of appearing in standard tillable soil is calculated by GameLocation::checkForBuriedItem.
