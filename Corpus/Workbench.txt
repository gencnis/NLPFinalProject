Workbench





When crafting here, you'll have access to materials in any adjacent chests.


Information 


Source:

Carpenter's Shop for 2,000g


Sell Price:

Cannot be sold


The Workbench allows players to craft items using ingredients which are stored in adjacent chests (any of the 8 surrounding spaces, including diagonally). It can be purchased from the Carpenter's Shop for 2,000g.
Similarly to how a dish can be prepared in the kitchen using ingredients stocked in nearby fridges, crafting an item with a Workbench will consume items stored in adjacent chests as if they were stored in the players inventory.
When crafting with the workbench, items are consumed in a similar order to the Refrigerator and Mini-Fridges:

The Player's Inventory
The oldest Chest placed by the player (in chronological order)
The next oldest Chest placed by the player, and so on.
History
1.4: Introduced.
1.4.2: Fixed a bug where the Workbench would not pull items from chests that were on rugs.
1.5: Price reduced from 3,000g to 2,000g.
