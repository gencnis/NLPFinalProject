Ingredients:

 Honey (1)


Mead is an Artisan Good made from placing Honey inside a Keg, taking 10 hours. It is also available at the Ginger Island Resort for 800g. Unlike Wine and Juice however, the value of the Mead is not affected by the type of honey used.  The sell price of Mead is 200g, and only aging or the Artisan Profession can increase it.  Several types of Flower Honey sell for more than Mead, so the player can actually lose money by making Mead.
Mead can also be obtained for free from the bar in the Pirate Cove by speaking with the bartender while wearing the Pirate Hat, Deluxe Pirate Hat, or Eye Patch. This can only be done once per night.
When consumed, Mead causes a Tipsy buff that decreases Speed by 1.
