The Mutant Bug Lair is an underground location that becomes accessible as part of the Dark Talisman Quest. The entrance to the lair is in the northwest corner of The Sewers. Talking to Krobus during this quest will open the passage to this location.
The player should be prepared to encounter monsters before entering the Mutant Bug Lair because there are a number of Mutant Grubs and Mutant Flies inside.
Even though plants are growing here and fishing is possible, the game considers this location to be underground.  Therefore, forageable items and artifact spots never spawn here.

Dark Talisman

The Wizard asked me to retrieve the magic ink from his ex-wife's house... but to gain access I'll need a dark talisman. Enter the sewer and ask Krobus about the dark talisman.

Enter the Railroad area after completing the Community Center Bundles or the Joja Community Development Form.

Speak to Krobus to gain entrance to the Mutant Bug Lair, then retrieve the Dark Talisman. Return to the Railroad area and place the Dark Talisman on the artifact blocking the cave.

Fishing
 Fishing Zones in the Mutant Bug Lair
The Slimejack is a unique fish that can only be caught in the Mutant Bug Lair. Carp, Green Algae, and White Algae are also possible. The available fish are the same year-round. Fishing here is dangerous because Mutant Flies continuously spawn and attack the player. To avoid this, fish right at the entrance before any bugs are triggered.
