Maple Tree


Maple Syrup is Tree sap made from the Tapper when it is placed on a Maple Tree, taking  9 days.
Maple Syrup can be obtained by tapping Maple Trees growing on The Farm or growing naturally in Stardew Valley (e.g., in Cindersap Forest). It can also rarely be obtained after processing Hardwood in a Wood Chipper.
Although Maple Syrup is labeled "Artisan Good" in-game, it does not benefit from the Artisan Profession, but instead from the Tapper Profession (+25% sell price).
