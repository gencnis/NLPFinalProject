Large Stumps are the remains of long-dead trees that are found on the Farm, the Secret Woods and The Mines. A copper Axe (or better quality) is required to remove a large stump, yielding 2 Hardwood and 25 Foraging Experience points.  Players with the Forester profession have a 50% chance of receiving one extra piece of hardwood. Stumps also have a 10% chance of dropping Mahogany Seeds.
Certain large stumps will respawn daily, providing a renewable source for hardwood:

All six large stumps in the Secret Woods respawn.
On the Forest Farm, there are eight large stumps at the west side that respawn. On the Four-corners Farm, there is one large stump in the top left quadrant of the map that respawns.
Large stumps in the mines (floors 41-69 with Shrine of Challenge activated) can be found.
All other large stumps on the farm disappear permanently after being removed.

Trivia
Destroying a large stump takes:
7 hits with a Copper Axe
