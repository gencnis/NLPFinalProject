The Sweet Gem Berry is a crop that grows from a Rare Seed after 24 days. It is not considered a Fruit or Vegetable and cannot be used in a Keg or Preserves Jar, nor does it benefit from the Tiller profession.
Rare Seeds can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for 1,000g in Spring & Summer, or for 600-1,000g in any season. A Seed Maker can also produce Rare Seeds from a Sweet Gem Berry.
Despite its high value, the berry is regarded as a neutral gift by all the NPCs in Stardew Valley. When given to Old Master Cannoli in the Secret Woods, however, the player receives a Stardrop in return. In multiplayer, all players receive a Stardrop with the gift of a single berry.
