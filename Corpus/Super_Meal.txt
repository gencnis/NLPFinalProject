Super Meal is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.
Super Meal may randomly appear in the Volcano Dungeon shop, Krobus' shop on Saturdays, or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock.  5 Super Meals may occasionally be found in a treasure room in the Skull Cavern. 1-2 Super Meals may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse exactly once.
