Carp is a fish that can be caught in the mountain lake or Wilderness Farm during Spring, Summer, or Fall. It can also be caught in the Secret Woods, The Sewers, or the Mutant Bug Lair during any season. It can also randomly be found at the Traveling Cart for 100-1,000g.
Carp is always most abundant in the Secret Woods, comprising between 41% and 53% of all items caught there when it isn't raining.[1]

Tailoring
Carp can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Vest.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as a yellow dye in the dye pots, located at Emily's and Haley's house 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Carp can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every day. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing two quests. The only possible output is yellow Carp Roe.

Quests
Item Delivery: One carp may be randomly requested during Spring, Summer, or Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 90g and 150 Friendship points.
Fishing: Demetrius or Willy may randomly request 1-5 carp during Spring, Summer, or Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 30g per fish.  (You get to keep the fish).
Two Carp may be requested by Dorado, Lingcod, or Pike in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 3 to 5.
Note
Carp are one of the easiest fish to catch, rarely moving past the 3rd bar on the fishing meter in the fishing mini-game, making it easy to get "Perfect" on its catches.
