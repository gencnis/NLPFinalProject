The Rainbow Trout is a fish that can be caught in the river (in Pelican Town and Cindersap Forest) and the mountain lake during Summer during sunny weather. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer, or at the Traveling Cart for 195-1,000g.
Rainbow Trout can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait.

Tailoring
Rainbow Trout can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Fish Shirt.  
It can also be used as an orange dye in the dye pots located in Haley's and Emily's house, 2 Willow Lane. 

Fish Pond
Rainbow Trout can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The primary output is orange Rainbow Trout Roe. However, more valuable items are possible starting at population 9, including a 0.09% daily chance of producing a Prismatic Shard.

Quests
Item Delivery: One rainbow trout may be randomly requested in Summer at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 195g and 150 Friendship points.
Fishing: Demetrius or Willy may randomly request 1-4 rainbow trout during Summer at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 65g per fish.  (You get to keep the fish).

History
1.4: Added iridium quality.  Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.4.4: Fixed a mistake in the game data that prevented rainbow trout-specific fish pond data from being applied (in earlier versions, rainbow trout used the same fish pond data as all generic river fish).
1.5: Special Order quest added.
