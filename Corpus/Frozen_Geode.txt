Sell Price:

100g

The Frozen Geode is a Mineral deposit that contains minerals, artifacts, ores, or basic resources. It can be found on levels 41 to 79 of The Mines, on the farm in the Winter, or inside a Fishing Treasure Chest.  It can also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star.  An Ice Pip Fish Pond may produce 1 or 5 Frozen Geodes when the population of the pond reaches 9. Frozen Geodes can also be obtained by pickaxing Frozen Geode Nodes. These are found in the small quarry on the Hill-top Farm and Four Corners Farm.
The Frozen Geode can be broken open by Clint in the Blacksmith shop for 25g or by using a Geode Crusher.

Resources
Note that Gold Ore is available in the Frozen Geode only after the player has reached level 76 of The Mines.  Before reaching level 76, Iron Ore is substituted when breaking open a Frozen Geode. Except for clay and stone, the following items will be obtained in the following amounts: 30% for 1, 30% for 3, 30% for 5, 9% for 10, and 1% for 20. Stone has a 50% chance to use those values and a 50% chance to give only 1. Only 1 clay can be obtained from a single geode.

Tailoring
Frozen Geode is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create a  Blue Hoodie. It is a cyan dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the blue dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in dyeing.

Quests
5 Frozen Geodes may be requested by Ice Pip in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 5 to 7.
1 Frozen Geode may be requested by several ocean fish in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 3 to 5.
Trivia
By multiplying the sell price of each item by the chance to obtain it and how many you would receive on average (with ores, clay and stone) and adding those products together, you can find the average profit of breaking open a single frozen geode. Frozen geodes have an average return of 100.43g, or 75.43g with the 25g opening cost factored in. With the Gemologist Profession, frozen geodes have an average return of 125.29g, or 100.29g with the 25g opening cost factored in. However, the frozen geode will sell in the shipping bin for 100g, giving a net profit of just 0.29g with Gemologist, and a net loss of 24.57g without Gemologist. It is therefore just about profitable to process frozen geodes and sell the contents with Gemologist, but it is not profitable to do so without Gemologist.
