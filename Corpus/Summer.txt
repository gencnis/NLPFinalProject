Summer is the second season new players play through. It is followed by Fall and preceded by Spring.
In Summer, grass remains green, although noticeably yellower than the spring grass was. Trees are no longer in bloom and instead are thick with vibrant green leaves. Butterflies can be seen flying across the screen. Any Spring crops still planted wilt and die on the 1st of Summer. New crops, fish, and forageable items are available, however.
