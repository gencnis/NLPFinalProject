Evelyn cutscene after completing the Greenhouse

 Clay (1) Stone (10) Refined Quartz (1)


A Garden Pot is a crafted item that allows crops to be grown indoors. It can also be used to grow crops on The Farm or the Ginger Island Farm. The crops can be from any season, except outdoors on The Farm, where they must be from the current season. A Garden Pot cannot grow Ancient Seeds, rejecting them at any time, indoors or outdoors.
Soon after the Greenhouse is completed, Evelyn visits the farm and gives the player one Garden Pot and the recipe for crafting more. The cutscene triggers when the player exits the Farmhouse between 6am and 11:30am on a day when it's not raining.
Flowers planted in Garden Pots will not enable nearby Bee Houses to produce flower honey.
Wild Seeds grown in Garden Pots do not benefit from the Botanist Profession, and will always be normal quality.
Crows do not attack crops grown in Garden Pots.  Giant crops cannot be grown in garden pots, just as they cannot be grown in the greenhouse.

Use
Garden Pots can be placed and produce crops "indoors" - that is, in any space not affected by weather.  Available locations include the Farmhouse, Island Farmhouse, all farm buildings, The Cave, The Tunnel, The Sewers, the Mutant Bug Lair, the Witch's Swamp, the entrances to The Mines and Skull Cavern, and villagers' homes.
Garden Pots accept crop seeds (other than ancient seeds) in outdoor areas on The Farm or the Ginger Island Farm. They accept only Tea Saplings elsewhere outdoors, however.
Garden Pots do not need to be tilled with a Hoe before planting.  Fertilizer of all types may be used in Garden Pots, with the same restrictions and benefits as in tilled soil.
Garden Pots cannot be watered with sprinklers. As a result, players must water crops in Garden Pots on a daily basis with a Watering Can, or less often if they use a type of Retaining Soil. If the player fertilizes the Garden Pot with Deluxe Retaining Soil, the crop only needs to be watered once.
Once placed, a Garden Pot may be removed with a tool or by holding left-click.  Removing a Pot that contains seeds or crops will destroy the seeds/crops.

Notes
An attempt to place Ancient Seeds in a Garden Pot displays the message "Her roots grow very deep... She wouldn't be happy in there."
An attempt to plant a seed from the current growing season (including Cactus Seeds) in an outdoor area outside the farms displays the message "Must be planted on farm".
Cactus Seeds planted in a Garden Pot outdoors on one of the farms will be dead the next day.
Garden Pots placed outside the farm are subject to being destroyed if placed in a villager's path.  See Crafting for maps of safe locations.
