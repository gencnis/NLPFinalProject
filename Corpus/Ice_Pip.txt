The Ice Pip is a fish that can be caught in the Mines on the 60th floor during all seasons. The only other fish that can be caught there is the Ghostfish.
The chances of hooking an Ice Pip depends on fishing level and on the fishing zone of the spot fished, increasing by 4.5% if a Curiosity Lure is equipped. For example, at level 10 fishing and fishing zone of 5, the chances of hooking an Ice Pip is 6.45%. With a Curiosity Lure equipped, this increases to 10.95%.[1]

Tailoring
The Ice Pip can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the  Fishing Hat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a blue dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Ice Pips can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 5 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. The primary output is blue Ice Pip Roe, but Iron Ore is possible at population 3 and several more valuable items are possible starting at population 9.

References

↑ See MineShaft::getFish in the game code. While Data\Fish.xnb suggests that a fishing level of 5 is needed to hook an Ice Pip, the data in MineShaft::getFish, which does not have any level conditions, overrides it. This means that there is no fishing level requirement to hook an Ice Pip.


History
1.4: Added iridium quality.  Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.5: Chance of catching it can now be increased by using a Curiosity Lure.
