Tailoring
Tiger Trout can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Fish Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Tiger Trout can be placed in a Fish Pond, but unlike all other fish, they cannot reproduce. [1]  The pond must be filled with caught Tiger Trout to reach maximum capacity. The initial pond capacity is 10 fish; no quests are necessary to increase the pond capacity. The only possible output is dark brown Tiger Trout Roe.

Quests
Fishing: Willy may randomly request 1-4 Tiger Trout during Fall or Winter at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 150g per fish.  (You get to keep the fish).
Aquatic Overpopulation: Demetrius may request 10 Tiger Trout to be caught in Fall at the Special Orders board outside the Mayor's Manor for a reward of gold equivalent to selling the fish and the Farm Computer recipe.
Trivia
In real life, as in the game, Tiger Trout are a sterile hybrid of the Brown Trout and the Brook Trout, unable to reproduce.
References

↑  In the game code the spawn rate for Tiger Trout is set to 999999 meaning it could technically reproduce after that number of days. To reach that number of days in Stardew Valley would require over 8900 years of the game to be played. 


History
