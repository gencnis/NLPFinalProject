Processing Time:

 10,000m (≈7d)


Ingredients:

Any Fruit (1)


 For a detailed analysis of profit using the Keg, see Keg Productivity.
 For a full list of wine prices, see Fruits.
Wine is an Artisan Good made from the Keg, taking 7 days.  It can also be received as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star.
The sell price of Wine depends on the fruit used (3 × Base Fruit Value).  When consumed, wine causes a Tipsy buff that decreases Speed by 1.  The healing effect of Wine is the same no matter what fruit is used to make it.
Note: It is possible to acquire Wine that has no base fruit (from the Traveling Cart or a Statue Of Endless Fortune, as a gift at the Feast of the Winter Star, or a New Year's Eve gift from Leah or Elliott). This item is simply titled "Wine", and has a selling price of 400g (or 560g with the Artisan Profession).

Aged Values
Wine can be placed inside a Cask to age from normal quality to silver, gold, and eventually iridium quality. Iridium quality doubles the base sell price of Wine.  
Wine takes the longest to age of any item in Casks. It takes 2 seasons of aging to go from basic wine to iridium quality wine.
Normal, silver, and gold quality Wine can be prematurely removed from a cask at any time by striking the cask with an Axe, Hoe, or Pickaxe.
