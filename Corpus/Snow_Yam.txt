The Snow Yam is a foraging item found only in Winter. Wild snow yams do not grow above ground, but instead they are buried in the snow/dirt and must be dug up with a Hoe (no other tools, even Bombs, will work).
The highest chance of finding a Snow Yam (11-16%, map-dependent) is when digging up an Artifact Spot.[1]  There is also a 4% chance of finding a Snow Yam when digging standard tillable soil in any exterior location.[2]  Exceptions are in the Farm, where Snow Yams can be found at artifact spots, but not standard tillable soil, and in the Desert, where Snow Yams can not be found at all.  Digging up a Snow Yam provides no experience.
Snow Yams can also be grown from Winter Seeds, in which case they are a standard wild-seed crop: they grow above ground, can be harvested without using a tool, give 7 Foraging XP each, and are affected by the Gatherer and Botanist professions.

↑ The chance of appearing in an artifact spot is calculated by GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot.  The base chance in code is 20% (0.5*0.4), but the actual chance is lower because artifacts and lost books are checked first and must all fail their checks.

↑ The chance of appearing in standard tillable soil is calculated by GameLocation::checkForBuriedItem.
