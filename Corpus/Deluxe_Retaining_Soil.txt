 Island Trader for  Cinder Shard (50)

 Stone (5) Fiber (3) Clay (1)

Deluxe Retaining Soil is a Fertilizer that keeps soil watered. It can be crafted after purchasing the recipe from the Island Trader for 50 Cinder Shards. 5-7 Deluxe Retaining Soil may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least two times.
Deluxe Retaining Soil can be placed on tilled soil before or after planting a seed, or at any stage of crop growth. The chance for retaining water is 100%, which means after watering once the soil will be guaranteed to be watered up until the crop is ready to be harvested. This makes it especially useful in situations where Sprinklers are unavailable, such as in Garden Pots or in most areas on the Beach Farm.
