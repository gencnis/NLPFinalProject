 Evelyn (4-heart event)


Ingredients:

 Wheat Flour (1) Sugar (1) Egg (1)

Cookie is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.
The Cookie recipe is normally obtained during Evelyn's 4-heart event.  If, however, players experience a bug in which they view Evelyn's event but don't receive the recipe, it will be sold at The Stardrop Saloon for 300g.
Cookies can be received as a gift from Evelyn at the Feast of the Winter Star, and are rarely found in the Garbage Can outside George and Evelyn's home.  Cookies may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock.  If the player's character is male, after he earns 5,000g he will receive a letter from mom with cookies enclosed.
