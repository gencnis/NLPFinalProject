Note that processing times are approximate, since time passes differently from 2am to 6am.  One hour = 60 minutes from 6am to 2am, but 1 hour = 100 minutes from 2am to 6am. One full day is 1600 minutes, where day is 1200 minutes and night is 400 minutes.

Preserves Jar vs. Keg
The Preserves Jar increases the profit of a crop using the following equation:  (2 × Base Crop Value + 50), while the Keg multiplies the base value of Fruits by 3, and most Vegetables by 2.25.  Because of this, low-value high-yield crops like Corn or Tomatoes are more valuable in the preserves jar.  The keg, on the other hand, favors crops with a much higher base value, such as Ancient Fruit or Melons. The breakpoint is 50g for fruits and 200g for vegetables.
Below is a list of crops that are more beneficial to be put in the keg, along with their raw base price.  Boldfaced items have a base price above 200g.



Fruits

Vegetables



 Ancient Fruit (550g)
 Apple (100g)
 Banana (150g)
 Cactus Fruit (75g)
 Cherry (80g)
 Coconut (100g)
 Cranberries (75g)
 Crystal Fruit (150g)
 Grape (80g)
 Mango (130g)
 Melon (250g)
 Orange (100g)
 Peach (140g)
 Pineapple (300g)
 Pomegranate (140g)
 Rhubarb (220g)
 Spice Berry (80g)
 Starfruit (750g)
 Strawberry (120g)
 Wild Plum (80g)


 Pumpkin (320g)
 Red Cabbage (260g)
 Hops (25g, but Pale Ale sells for 300g)
 Wheat (25g, but Beer sells for 200g)

It should be noted that these calculations only involve the value gained in terms of max profit; if looking at profit per day based on the time required, the preserves jar will outpace the keg regardless of the base value of the item (in every case except for Hops and Wheat) since the preserves jar has a much faster processing time.

Storage Options
Inside Farm Buildings
Kegs can be stored in farm buildings. 
A Shed, optimally filled with kegs, holds 67 of them, while occupying only 21 tiles of land. An upgraded Big Shed, optimally filled, holds 137 kegs on the same land space. A Barn, however, is cheaper, and holds 90 kegs on 28 tiles of land. The Deluxe Barn increases building costs considerably, but has so far been shown to be able to fit 136 kegs on the same land space as the initial Barn. Coops are cheaper still, but smaller, permitting fewer kegs per tile of external farmland used. Cabins are the cheapest initially, occupy the smallest land area of 15 tiles, but can only hold 42 kegs without upgrades, assuming the cabin is unclaimed and the parsnips and bed must remain. The first level of upgraded cabin can hold 113 kegs at a lower cost than any other option. While the second upgrade significantly raises costs, 351 kegs can be stored in a fully renovated cabin, allowing the largest number of kegs per external farmland used.

Outside The Farm
See also: Crafted goods outside the farm
Kegs can be stored almost anywhere outside the farm.  Out of the way places are best as NPCs walking through a keg will destroy it.  Other good options not pictured are the Desert and the Railroad.





374 Kegs in the Quarry.






131 Kegs in The Tunnel.






90 Kegs on the Road. 2 are inside the tunnel.

History
1.0: Introduced.
1.1: Mead Added. Removed Clay from crafting recipe.
1.4: Green Tea Added.  Adjusted processing time so that machines process 100 minutes from 2am to 6am, not every hour the player is asleep. Kegs can now be stacked in a player's inventory and in chests.
