The Crystalarium will replicate any inserted Gem, Foraged Mineral, or Geode Mineral. It can be crafted or found in a treasure room in the Skull Cavern. Note, however, that Crystalariums cannot replicate Prismatic Shards. The functions of the Crystalarium are explained in the Lost Book Technology Report!.
One Crystalarium is the reward for donating 50 Minerals to the Museum. One Crystalarium is also the reward for completing the  25,000 Bundle in the Vault.
Once an item is inserted, it will replicate that item an infinite number of times. Once a gem or mineral has been inserted into the Crystalarium, it can be retrieved at any time by removing the Crystalarium with a tool.

Tips
The most profitable gem to replicate is the Diamond, yielding a profit of 150g per day if harvested as soon as it is ready (five days). At this rate, the base monetary value of the materials used in crafting the Crystalarium can be recovered in about 32 days (not including a Diamond used to seed it, nor any increase in the value of the crafting materials due to profession bonuses).
Diamonds are also either liked or loved by all villagers making the replication of Diamonds extremely useful for gift-giving purposes.
Only 7 hours is required to replicate Quartz, the shortest time span for any mineral. While the Crystalarium is thus an efficient source of Quartz for making Refined Quartz, Quartz is found abundantly during mining and making Refined Quartz still requires Coal for smelting. Refined Quartz can also be produced directly in a Recycling Machine from Broken Glasses and Broken CDs, without needing coal.
Five Quartz can be traded at the Desert Trader for 1 Bomb, making the replication of Quartz in Crystalariums a more efficient method of obtaining Bombs than purchasing them from the Dwarf's shop for 600g each.
The Crystalarium can replicate Jade for trading with the Desert Trader for Staircases on Sundays. This can save countless hours gathering stone.
When changing the gem in a Crystalarium, first break the Crystalarium to get the seeded gem back (otherwise the gem in the Crystalarium will be lost and replaced with the new gem). Then place it down again and insert the new gem.
