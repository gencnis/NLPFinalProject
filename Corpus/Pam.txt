“

“I was reading the newspaper this morning but then I got depressed. It's a rotten world, kid. Keep your head screwed on right and you'll make it through in one piece... That's what my Pappy always used to say. Heh heh heh.”


— Pam


Pam is a villager who lives in the trailer just west of the river in Pelican Town. She was the driver of the Pelican Town bus before it broke down. Once the bus service has been restored, Pam will manage the bus stop just east of the farm, opening the way to the The Desert.
While the bus service is not active, Pam can usually be found in her home until 12:00pm. She'll then walk over to JojaMart for a few hours, leaving there at 4:00pm to walk to The Stardrop Saloon. Pam is one of Gus' most loyal customers. She spends every evening in his establishment.
Pam has her doctor's appointment on Spring 25, and thus the bus service will not be active on that day.
If the beach resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, she may visit it on some days, causing the bus service to be inactive. This can be avoided by closing the resort to visitors. 

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Pam may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Pam will immediately go home to bed. Pam never visits the Resort on Fall 15, Festival days, or her checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.
Shown below are Pam's schedules prioritized highest to lowest. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

Details 


You find Pam praying before a Sign of the Vessel statue.  She confesses that she loves the new house, but hasn't been able to cut back on her drinking.  She says she thought the new house would change everything, but it didn't, so she ordered the statue.  She then turns to the player for a response.
I'm glad you're feeling hopeful (No effect on friendship.)
Pam says she's "getting sappy" in her old age, and the cutscene ends.  

Sorry Pam, but Yoba isn't real... (-1000 friendship.)
Pam becomes angry and asks "What in the void is wrong with you?" before declaring her faith in Yoba and ordering you to leave.

Trivia
In v1.3, Pam no longer follows you into the bus when purchasing a ticket to the desert.  Instead, she stands in place until the bus cutscene triggers.  This may have been done to prevent the rare "disappearing Pam" bug, in which Pam would disappear from the game and never return.

1.4: Fixed bug where all recipes would be sent at 3 friendship hearts.
