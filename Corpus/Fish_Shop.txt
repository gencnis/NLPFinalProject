Fish Shop








Open Hours:

9am to 5pm


Closed:

Non-rainy Saturdays (Building Open, no sales)


Occupants:

 Willy


The Fish Shop is the home of Willy. It's located on the docks of The Beach south of Pelican Town. If the player has not read the letter from Willy sent on Spring 2, then the shop cannot be entered. Although the door will unlock on Saturdays, the shop will be closed unless it is raining.
Willy sells a variety of fishing-related supplies, including rods, bait, tackle, fish tanks, and crab pots. Some items, such as tackles, become available once the player reaches a specific fishing level. Those items can be purchased as soon as the appropriate skill level is achieved, without needing to wait until the next day. Other items, such as the Copper Pan and the Deluxe Fish Tank, require the player to complete specific tasks to become available.

Purchases
Willy will buy the following items from the player: All Fish, Bait, Tackle, Beach Forageables (except Seaweed), Roe, and Squid Ink.[1]
He will not buy any other catchable items (Trash, Green Algae, Seaweed, or White Algae). He will also not buy Aged Roe or Caviar.

Player-Derived Stock
If the player chooses to sell items to Willy, there is a chance they will appear in the list of items for sale, especially if sold to Willy in large quantity.  Any of these items will be available for purchase in limited quantities. Additional villager dialogues may appear indicating they've seen or purchased the items.

Willy's Boat



Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

After completing three Community Center Bundles, entering the Fish Shop will trigger a cutscene, Willy doesn't need to be there and weather doesn't matter. In the cutscene he will chat with the player about how they're doing on fishing, and finally hint on the fact that if the Community Center gets restored, he will show them "something".

 Willy and Robin put the Ginger Island boat back into operation.
Willy's Boat is then introduced when Willy mails the player an invitation to come to the back room of his shop. The invitation arrives two days after either all bundles for the Community Center have been donated or the Joja Community Development Form has been completed. The celebration/recognition ceremony need not be seen to generate the letter.
Upon arriving at the back room, the player finds a hidden dock with an old boat that is out of service. Willy can use the boat to provide transport to and from Ginger Island at a ticket price of 1,000g, but he does not have the materials needed for repairs.
The player's task is to provide the materials to restore service, namely, the following items:
 Hardwood (200) for the hull
 Iridium Bar (5) for the anchor
 Battery Pack (5) for the ticket stand
Once the player leaves all the needed items in the back room, the game generates an overnight cutscene in which Willy and Robin work to restore boat service. Note that this cutscene is delayed a day if another overnight cutscene is scheduled for the same night.
From the day after the cutscene runs, the player can buy a boat ticket in the back room. The shop doors unlock at 8am instead of 9am for earlier starts. Willy's own schedule does not change. He pilots the boat, but he becomes available automatically whenever the player purchases a ticket and doesn't need to be in the shop beforehand.
By fishing inside the boat room there is a 20% chance to catch a Lifesaver.[2]

Trivia
Interacting with the ladder at the back of the shop results in a message that suggests Willy lives upstairs.
If the player attempts to enter the Fish Shop on Spring 1, Year 1, a note on the door says "Gone Fishing, be back tomorrow".
