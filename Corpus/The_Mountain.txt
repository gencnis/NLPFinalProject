The Mountain is an exterior region in the northern part of Stardew Valley. Initially, there are only two exits: to the south leading to Pelican Town, and to the west leading to the Backwoods.  However, over the course of the game, several events open up new routes:

On Spring 5, debris blocking the bridge north of the lake is cleared, providing access to the Mines and the Adventurer's Guild.
On Summer 3, an earthquake opens a pass north from the Mountain to the Railroad.
The bridge leading to the Quarry at the east end of the map can be repaired (by completing all Crafts Room Bundles or purchasing "Bridge" from the Joja Community Development Form for 25,000g).
The Glittering Boulder blocking the water flow west of the mine entrance can be removed (by completing all Fish Tank Bundles or purchasing "Panning" from the Joja Community Development Form for 20,000g).

Forageable items spawn at an average rate of 0.5 per night.[2] The map shows the possible locations as red and magenta tiles; when the original trees are present, the magenta tiles have a 90% smaller chance of spawning items because they are identified as being behind the original trees.

Villager Paths
 Villager Paths at the Mountain
Several villagers walk through the western section of the Mountain map and have the potential to destroy items:


Fishing
 Fishing Zones in the Mountain Lake.
A large lake containing many types of fish fills the middle of the Mountain map. The Carp found here are particularly easy to catch, making the lake a good location to practice fishing early in the game. A Legendary Fish, the Legend, is also found here, as well as the Legend II, one of the five legendary fish II.
