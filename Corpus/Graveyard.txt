Gravestones
There are 4 gravestones within the roughly 300 square tiles that are the Graveyard.

Mona


The only gravestone with a name attributed to it, it sits in the middle of the top 3 stones.  The epitaph reads:




“

“Our Beloved Mona”


Abigail can be seen sitting next to Mona's gravestone during her 6-heart event. She also stands in front of it, depending on her schedule.

Old and Faded

The gravestone to the left of Mona's reads:




“

“It's old and faded...”


Dwarvish Headstone

After obtaining the Dwarvish Translation Guide, the gravestone to the right of Mona's reads:




“

“You translate the dwarvish:Stand between the pillars threeWith gift as precious as the sky:A rainbow forged from land, not seaThen galaxies will heed your cry.”


This is referring to the three pillars in the northeast of the Calico Desert.

Unknown

The stone that is the bottom left of the four is currently unclickable.
