The Fiddlehead Fern is a vegetable that can be found:

Foraging in the Secret Woods during Summer (78%).
Foraging in the Prehistoric floors of the Skull Cavern.
Foraging on levels 41-69 of the Mines while the Shrine of Challenge is active.
Foraging in the Ginger Island jungle in all seasons.
Occasionally at the Traveling Cart for 270-1,000g.
The Fiddlehead Fern is the only foraged item categorized as a vegetable. Being a vegetable, its sell price benefits from the Tiller 10% bonus and it can be turned into Pickles or Juice using a Preserves Jar or Keg. But it also receives several Foraging-related benefits, because it is obtained by foraging.  Specifically, 7 Foraging XP is granted per fern and it benefits from the Gatherer double-harvest bonus and Botanist iridium-quality bonus.

Tailoring
Fiddlehead Fern is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with Cloth in the feed to create  Green Overalls. It is a green dye when used in the spool of the Sewing Machine with a dyeable clothing item in the feed. It can be placed in the green dye pot at Emily's and Haley's house for use in dyeing.
Green overalls may reference Luigi, from the Super Mario series. The description of the overalls also allude to this.
