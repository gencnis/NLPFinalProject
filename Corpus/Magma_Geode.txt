Tailoring
Magma Geode is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Red Hoodie.   It can also be used in dyeing, serving as a red dye at the dye pots located in Emily and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
Magma Geode is not used in any quests.

Trivia
By multiplying the sell price of each item by the chance to obtain it and how many you would receive on average (with ores, clay and stone) and adding those products together, you can find the average profit of breaking open a single magma geode. Magma geodes have an average return of 167.34g, or 142.34g with the 25g opening cost factored in. With the Gemologist Profession, magma geodes have an average return of 207.87g, or 182.87g with the 25g opening cost factored in. However, a magma geode will sell in the shipping bin for 150g, giving a net profit of 32.87g with Gemologist, and a net loss of 7.66g without Gemologist. It is therefore profitable to process magma geodes and sell the contents with Gemologist, but it is not profitable to do so without Gemologist.
