The Diamond is a Mineral that can be obtained from Diamond Nodes in the Mines on floors 50+ and Gem Nodes in the Mines on any floor.  
A diamond may also be dropped by any Monster after reaching the bottom of the Mines.  Before reaching the bottom of the Mines, a Diamond may be dropped by a Red, Purple, Copper, or Iron Slime, or a Duggy.  A Wilderness Golem may also rarely drop a diamond (0.1% chance).
Diamonds may also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests or by panning.  After the player has reached the bottom of the Mines, they may also be found in Garbage Cans.  An Ice Pip or Stonefish Fish Pond may produce a Diamond when the population of the pond reaches 9.
The Lost Book A Study on Diamond Yields contains information about the chances of finding diamond nodes in the mines on a given level.
A Diamond is arguably the best gem to duplicate in the Crystalarium, providing the largest source of money as a gem. Diamonds are also liked or loved by all giftable NPCs.
The Desert Trader in the Calico Desert will trade one Triple Shot Espresso for one Diamond.
