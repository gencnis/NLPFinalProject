Desert TraderMonster drop in Skull Cavern


Sell Price:

4,500g


The Void Ghost Pendant is an item that can be purchased from the Desert Trader for 200 Void Essence. It can also be dropped by monsters in the Skull Cavern.  
It allows the player to invite Krobus to move into their house as a roommate, similar to how the Mermaid's Pendant is used to propose marriage.  Only one can be obtained at a time, similar to the Mermaid's Pendant.

Notes
It is possible to obtain two Void Ghost Pendants, by purchasing one at the Desert Trader, then placing it in a chest, then entering the Skull Cavern and killing monsters in the same day.
It is impossible to obtain if the player is already married to one of the marriage candidates.
After purchasing the pendant and moving Krobus in, the Old Mariner will respond "Glad the Amulet worked out for ye, lad/miss." when spoken to.
