Cactus Seeds are a type of seed. Mature plants yield Cactus Fruit.  
They can be purchased only from Sandy at the Oasis for 150g.  Two to five Cactus Seeds can also be obtained from a Sandfish or Scorpion Carp Fish Pond when the population of the pond reaches 10.  Fifteen Cactus Seeds may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern.
Cactus Seeds can be planted outdoors on the Farm, but will be either missing or dead the next day.  Cactus plants may only be grown in the Greenhouse, or inside another building using a Garden Pot, or on Ginger Island.
Harvesting Cactus plants gives Farming experience points.
