The Grape is a fruit that is both a forageable item and a standard crop:

In Summer, Grapes are a forageable fruit found that grows wild throughout Stardew Valley or can be grown from Summer Seeds.  Specifically, forageable Grapes can be found at: the Backwoods (62% of all forageable items at this location); the Mountain (62%); the Bus Stop (27%); the Railroad (27%); or, the Forest Farm Map (25%).
In Fall, Grapes are a standard crop that takes ten days to grow from a Grape Starter to maturity; the plants can be re-harvested every three days.
Grapes grown as a crop (in Fall) receive the +10% Tiller profession bonus when sold (as do all crops). However, foraged Grapes in summer do not get the Tiller bonus. If you combine Summer and Fall grapes into the same stack, the entire stack will receive the Tiller bonus (see the Fruit page for more details).
Other than the Tiller profession bonus, foraged Grapes and crop-grown Grapes are identical and can be used interchangeably in crafting, gifts, bundles, recipes, and quests.
