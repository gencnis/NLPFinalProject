The Common Mushroom is a mushroom found via foraging throughout Stardew Valley in the Fall. They can be found in the Secret Woods during Spring and Fall, Forest Farm during Summer, and in the Ginger Island mushroom cave. They can be grown from Wild Seeds (Fa) or in mushroom bins in the The Cave if the mushroom option is chosen. They can also be obtained by tapping a Mushroom Tree.  
Putting a Common Mushroom in a Seed Maker will generate 1-3 Fall Seeds.

Tailoring
Common Mushroom is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create a Shirt.  It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.
This shirt is very likely a reference to the Super Mario game series, where the titular character Mario commonly eats mushrooms.

Quests
The Common Mushroom may be randomly requested in Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 120g and 150 Friendship points.
2-3 Common Mushrooms may be requested by Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Midnight Carp, or Woodskip in Fish Pond quests.
Trivia
Common Mushrooms are the only fall forageable that can be directly put into the Seed Maker.
History
