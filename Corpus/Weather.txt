 The Weather Channel



“

“Welcome to KOZU 5... your number one source for weather, news, and entertainment.  And now, the weather forecast for tomorrow...”


Weather changes daily and with the seasons. The weather for the next day can be checked by viewing the TV screen and selecting "Weather Report." 

 The Fern Islands weather report
The weather on Ginger Island is different from in Stardew Valley, and once unlocked, the Fern Islands weather report will display immediately after the Stardew Valley report.
Daily weather affects the types of fish that can be caught, as well as villager dialogues and behavior.

Weather Chances
The chance that a particular day will be be sunny/rainy/stormy/etc. depends on a number of different factors. See Modding:Weather data.
Ginger Island only has two types of weather: sun and rain. The chance for rain is 24% (0% on first visit).[1]

Notes
Storm
It always rains on stormy days. Fish that require rain can be caught on stormy days, and the Old Mariner will appear on stormy days.
During a storm, lightning strikes can destroy random tiles on the farm. This includes crops and trees. If a Fruit Tree is hit, it will temporarily change into a coal tree.
If lightning hits a tile with a crafted flooring or path on it, the flooring or path will be displaced but not permanently destroyed.
There is a chance for a lightning strike to occur every 10 minutes.
Lightning will not strike Chests placed outside[2].
If Lightning Rods are placed anywhere on the farm[3] they have a good chance to intercept lightning strikes, as long as they are not already processing a strike into a Battery Pack.
Using a Rain Totem never has a chance to cause a storm unless used on a stormy day (which will make the next day stormy as well). Otherwise it will only cause rain.
It is always stormy on Summer 13 and 26, every year.
Snow
Winter Seeds need to be watered even if it is snowing.
Snow transparency can be changed in the Options Menu.  Sliding the bar to the left will increase snow transparency (i.e., decrease opacity).
Other
On the first year, it is always sunny on Spring 1, 2, and 4, and it always rains on Spring 3. From Spring 5 and onwards, the weather is randomized, with certain exceptions.
The Rain Totem will change the weather for the following day to rain unless the following day is a festival or the 1st day of a season.  (Spring 2-4 of year 1 can also not be changed by a Rain Totem.)
The weather will always be "clear and sunny" for Festivals.
It will never rain in Winter unless a Rain Totem is used.
If there is a Festival on a player's wedding day, the heart icon will not display.
For all villager heart events, there are only two defined weather states:  Sun and Rain.  This means that any event that requires a "Sunny" day can trigger on windy or snowy days as well as sunny days.  Thunderstorm days count as rainy days, so "sunny" events will not trigger.
Bugs
The TV will not necessarily be accurate for Spring 2 or 4, or Summer 13 or 26.
The TV will predict stormy weather on Summer 25th, but not the 26th. If the player does not check the TV forecast on the 25th, it may not be stormy. (See Modding:Weather data for more information.)
Trivia
While winter can't have windy weather without modding, there is still an unseen message for such weather in the weather forecast: "It's going to snow all day. Make sure you bundle up, folks!"
