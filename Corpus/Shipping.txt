“

“If you have anything to sell, just place it in this box here. I'll come by during the night to collect it.”


— Lewis


Shipping allows the player to sell items by placing them into a Shipping Bin or Mini-Shipping Bin.  Gold is received after going to sleep for the night.
 Iridium quality items have the highest value, followed by  gold,  silver, and regular quality items, in that order. The amount of gold received from shipping is the same as when selling to a merchant. The main difference is that merchants will pay immediately, while the money received from shipping is given the next day.  Also, not all items can be sold using both methods: some items can only be sold using the shipping bin; other items that cannot be placed in the shipping bin can be sold to merchants (notably, weapons can be sold to the Adventurer's Guild).  Items sold to merchants are not included in the statistics on the Collection tab and do not count towards shipping-specific Achievements.
The shipping bin opens its lid when the player approaches it.  To ship an item (or stack of items), approach the shipping bin and "use" it (right-click on it), then left-click on the item in inventory.  Alternatively, select an item in inventory, approach the shipping bin, and left-click on the bin.
If a mistake is made and the wrong item is put in the shipping bin, "use" the bin at any time during the same day to display the last item. Click on that item to add it back into inventory. Only the last item shipped can be retrieved.
The player begins the game with one Shipping Bin located near the mailbox on The Farm, but more can be purchased at the Carpenter's Shop for 250g and  Wood (150).  These can be placed anywhere on the farm.
