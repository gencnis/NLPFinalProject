The Bee House is a type of Artisan Equipment used to make Honey. A Bee House is the reward for completing the  Fall Crops Bundle in the Pantry. 
To make honey, place a Bee House on the farm during any season but winter, and wait 4 nights. Bee houses can be placed indoors (e.g., in the Greenhouse) but will not produce honey there. Bee houses placed outside the farm will produce wild honey every 4 days, but they will be destroyed if they are placed in a villager's path.
A fully-grown and unharvested flower within 5 tiles of a Bee House will cause it to produce flower honey, which always sells for more than flowerless Wild Honey. Flowers that are normally foraged (i.e., Crocus and Sweet Pea) do not affect the honey. Additionally, a Dandelion or Daffodil will not affect the honey as these items are classified as forage rather than flowers. Flowers grown in Garden Pots will not cause Bee Houses to produce flower honey.
The type of honey is established the moment it is harvested. If a Bee House has produced flower honey, but the flower is harvested before the honey, the honey will become wild honey. Similarly, if a Bee House has produced flowerless wild honey, but the honey is harvested after a flower bloomed in range, the harvested honey will be flower honey.
If a Bee House is removed with a tool while it has flower honey ready for harvesting, the honey will go into inventory as "Wild Honey".

Range
 Flower zone indicator for modified Honey.
With the exception of Crocus and Sweet Pea, the Bee House can produce unique types of honey when it is within 5 tiles in any cardinal direction of a blooming flower. When there is more than one type of flower within range, the closest flower takes priority. At equal distances, the flower at the horizontal left takes priority, followed by the next clockwise flower.

Tips
Planting flowers near Bee Houses on Ginger Island will produce flavored Honey year-round.
