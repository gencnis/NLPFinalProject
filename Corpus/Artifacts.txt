For an index to the completed artifacts collection, see Collections#Artifacts.
Artifacts are items found primarily by digging up Artifact Spots, though they can be acquired in other ways. There are 42 artifacts in total, and one of each must be donated to the Museum to complete its collection. Donating to the Museum will yield rewards when donation milestones are reached, or when specific artifacts are donated.

Acquisition
Artifacts can be acquired in the following ways:

Using the Hoe on an Artifact Spot. Different parts of the map will produce different artifacts. Artifact Spots are much more common in winter.
Using the Hoe on dirt in The Mines and the Skull Cavern.
Killing Monsters.
Solving Secret Notes.
Breaking open Artifact Troves.
Fishing for treasure chests.
Breaking Bone Nodes.
The table below lists specific locations for each artifact.

Use
All artifacts can be used for:

Donation to the museum
Gifting to Penny and the Dwarf as liked gifts
Tailoring at a Sewing Machine
Some artifacts have other specific uses:

Dwarf Scroll I, Dwarf Scroll II, Dwarf Scroll III, Dried Starfish, and Golden Relic may be required for some Fish Pond quests.
Ancient Seed may be crafted into a plantable Ancient Seeds pack after one is donated to the museum.
Dinosaur Egg may be used to hatch a Dinosaur in an Incubator or turned into Dinosaur Mayonnaise.
Prehistoric or fossilized artifacts may be processed in the Bone Mill to obtain Fertilizer.
Ancient Doll is an option for the  Children's Bundle on the Bulletin Board (Remixed).
Dwarf Gadget is required to craft the Farm Computer.

Donating an Ancient Seed rewards the player with an Ancient Seed crafting recipe and 1 Ancient Seeds pack, which can then be planted to harvest Ancient Fruit.

↑ The contents of an artifact spot are calculated by GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot; the primary data source is ObjectInformation.xnb. 20% of the time a Lost Book is found (except on the Farm). Otherwise, each artifact is checked sequentially to see whether a random number is less than the chance specified by the input file; the first artifact that succeeds is the one found. One result of this algorithm is that the actual chance of finding a given artifact is smaller than the value in the input file, because it can only be found if the Lost Book check failed and all previous artifacts failed their tests.

↑ 2.00 2.01 2.02 2.03 2.04 2.05 2.06 2.07 2.08 2.09 2.10 2.11 2.12 2.13 2.14 2.15 2.16 2.17 2.18 2.19 The chance of an artifact appearing in a treasure chest is higher if Lost Books are not possible, e.g., after the Museum's collection is complete.

↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 The additional chance for this artifact is season-dependent. The maximum chance is in summer and fall.  In winter, the chance is 50% less; in spring it is 6% less. The chance comes from a secondary input file, Locations.xnb, which is only used if all other sources fail.


History
1.4: Fixed bug preventing certain artifacts from appearing in artifact spots in certain places.
1.5: Bone Mill turns bone items, including bone artifacts, into fertilizer. Penny and the Dwarf now like all artifacts as gifts, all other NPCs now dislike instead of hate artifacts as gifts.
