An Oak Tree is a common Tree that grows from an Acorn. It yields Oak Resin every 7-8 days when tapped. It can be chopped down with an axe, producing Wood, Sap, possible Acorns, and possible Hardwood (if the player is a Lumberjack).
A planted Acorn grows through four stages before reaching maturity (with twice as much time spent at stage 4).  If fertilized, this takes five days (even in Winter).  Otherwise, there is a 20% chance per day of growth, except in winter when trees do not grow.  The median time to maturity is 24 days, although individual tree growth times will vary considerably.
Chopping a stage 2–3 tree with an axe has a chance to drop one wood, depending on foraging level. This doesn't happen when cutting it with other tools.
Oak Trees outside the farm (except in Pelican Town) can be chopped down or tapped.  These trees will respawn as Stage 3 saplings (20% chance each day) and grow as normal after that, as long as the stump is removed.

History
1.4: Fixed bug that caused a stage 2-3 sapling to make a scythe sound when watered.  Fixed bug that prevented trees from dropping seeds and seeds disappearing when harvested if a Foraging level up occured during the day.  Planting tree seeds outside the farm no longer requires the spot to be tilled.  (This also prevents planting in non-tillable areas dug up by Artifact Spots in Winter).
