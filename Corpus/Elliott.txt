“

“Elliott lives alone in a cabin on the beach. He is a writer who dreams of one day writing a magnificent novel. He is a sentimental “romantic” with a tendency to go off onto flowery, poetic tangents. When he can afford it, he enjoys a strong beverage at the Stardrop Saloon. Could a humble farmer such as yourself be the inspiration Elliott is looking for? There’s only one way to find out…”


— Dev Update #12


Elliott is a villager who lives on the beach south of Pelican Town. He's one of the twelve characters available to marry.
During Spring, Summer, and Fall, players must first acquire two hearts of friendship with Elliott before being allowed inside his cabin. Players at any friendship level may enter in Winter between 10am and 6pm. 

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Elliott may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Elliott will immediately go home to bed. Elliott never visits the Resort on Festival days or his checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.

Heart Events
Two Hearts

Enter Elliott's cabin when he's there.



Details 


Elliott will greet you, and explain that he came to Pelican Town to become a writer but no one from his hometown believed he could make it. He asks what kind of novels you like:
"Mystery" (+30 friendship.)
"Romance" (+30 friendship.)
"Sci-Fi" (+30 friendship.)
He says he'll remember your choice, then asks you to look at his rose because he thinks it may be wilting.


Four Hearts

Enter the Stardrop Saloon between 3pm and 10pm when Gus is there.



Details 


Gus says he'll take your order in a moment. Before he gets to you, Elliott walks into the building and says it's a pleasant surprise to find you here. He says that he's stopping in to relax after eight hours of writing. He orders two ales, one for you and one for him. He orders wine for you if your character is female.
You stop him before he can drink and propose a toast. You can choose from four different toasts:

"To Pelican Town!" (+25 friendship.) "Ah, to a harmonious future for the community... what a virtuous idea. Here's to Pelican Town!"
"To our friendship!" (+50 friendship.) "That's a great idea! Here's to us!"
"To my good health!" (-10 friendship.) "Well... okay."
"To your doom!" (-50 friendship.) "Hmph. Forget it."
You both drink and he starts dancing where he is. Then the cutscene ends, and you are transported outside the door of the Stardrop Saloon.
Note: The beverage consumed during the heart event will heal up to 50 Energy and 22 Health, and leave the player with the "Tipsy" buff.


Six Hearts

Enter Elliott's home when he's there.



Details 


Elliott is playing the piano. After he finishes, the player has a dialogue option:
"That was wonderful" (No effect on friendship.)
"How long have you been playing?" (No effect on friendship.)
Elliott talks about how difficult it's been to finish his novel and says "Sometimes I wish I could just throw it all away and become a farmer like you."  The player can respond with:

"It's just as hard to be a farmer, you know" (No effect on friendship.)
Elliott apologizes for being insensitive and clarifies that what he really wants is to experience "real life".

"Come live on the farm, I could use the extra help" (No effect on friendship.)
Elliott is surprised but declines the offer, saying he needs to finish his novel.


Eight Hearts

After receiving a letter from Elliott, visit the museum between 1pm and 7pm. (It doesn't need to be the same day.)



Details 


Elliott sends you a letter inviting you to a reading of his finished novel at the library that afternoon.
When you enter the museum, you find many villagers have gathered to listen to Elliott's first book reading. Elliott expresses his delight at your coming to listen. He reads from his novel. Depending on your choice in his first heart event, you'll get one of these stories:

The mystery novel Blue Tower. "It's a mystery novel set in a surreal, dystopian future. Chapter One. From the shadows emerged a man, radiating with enigmatic omniscience. 'Good Evening, Mr. Lu,' he said, the corners of his mouth quivering. Lu seemed astonished. 'How did you know my name?'" (Fade.) "Lu checked Jenu's pockets, then stood up and walked into the bedroom. He quickly found the small golden key that he was looking for and slipped it into his coat pocket."
The romance novel Camellia Station. "It's a romance novel about a train stewardess who falls in love with a traveling architect... Chapter One. 'Your ticket, sir?' Ticket collector Gozman extended a gloved hand towards the young commuter. 'Ah, yes. I have it right here,' he replied, reaching into his coat pocket. Mortified, he discovered that the ticket was missing." (Fade.) "...'Clara, there's something I must tell you,' he blurted as she turned to leave. Clara turned, slowly, and saw the look of desperation in Horatio's eye. At that moment Gozman burst into the compartment, red-faced."
The sci-fi novel The Rise And Fall Of Planet Yazzo. "It's a sci-fi epic spanning thousands of years in an exotic planetary system. Chapter One. Commander Yutkin stepped through the golden archway as the airlock snapped shut behind him. Today was his first day on Planet Yazzo, and all 14 of the alliance delegates had been summoned to the Grand Spire..." (Fade.) "...And as the 7th moon descended beneath the horizon, the planet of Yazzo would begin its sinister transformation... an event for which Commander Yutkin was completely unprepared."
Elliott thanks everyone for coming, then walks up to you and asks how you think it went. He says he's glad that you liked it, because he dedicated it to you and he based it on your favorite genre.



Ten Hearts

Go to the beach on a day when it is not raining between 7am and 1pm. A letter will be sent to you but it is not needed to trigger the event.



Details 


Elliott writes you a letter saying he has an idea. You join him on the docks. Elliott had fixed the row boat that's been on the docks, and he wonders if you want to go with him on a "maiden voyage."
If you accept, Elliott talks about his novel and how he couldn't have done it without you. Then he's at a loss for words to explain how he feels about you. Suddenly, he kisses you! You begin trembling.
I'm happy (+50 friendship.)
If your character is a man, he will comment on how he didn't know if you would have feelings for another man. You both head back to shore, and Elliott comments on how the valley finally looks like home.
You're making me very uncomfortable. Stop. (-50 friendship.)
Elliott apologizes and the scene ends.
If you refuse, Elliott says "I see" and the event ends.

Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelors, raised friendship with each bachelor to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelor's 10-heart event, then entering The Stardrop Saloon will trigger a cutscene. If Alex is the final bachelor you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a friendly game of pool.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelors will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelors will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelors will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Exit the farm house between 6am and 3pm on a day when there are no Festivals occurring for the next 8 days.



Details 


Elliott will be on the front porch when the player leaves the farmhouse.
He'll send the player letters in the mail daily for a full week while he is touring for his book signing. 
On the 8th day the last part of the event will trigger as soon as the player wakes up.


Marriage
Main article: Marriage
Once married, Elliott will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a small garden behind the farmhouse where he'll sometimes go to read.
On rainy mornings and mornings when Elliott stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you Coffee.  On rainy nights, he may offer you dinner:  Baked Fish, Fried Calamari, Chowder, or Fish Stew.  On New Years' Eve (Winter 28), he'll give you a bottle of Wine.

8+ Hearts

“[Player], you've trudged through the snow to visit me? I'm honored!”

“A day can never be boring when you follow the whims of your imagination. Sorry, am I babbling on about nonsense?”





“

“Breathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea. How does it make you feel?”





“

“I have to brush my hair daily, or else it'll clump up into messy knots. It's a lot of work. I'm surprised I haven't just shaved it off in a fit of passion. I suppose I am too vain.”





“

“I've been doing little indoor exercises, since it's often too cold to go out. Sorry if it's a little humid in the cabin.”

“Ah, what a lovely day to read a book...don't you think, my dear?”


Indoor Nights




“

“A crackling fire adds wonderful ambiance to the house...every piece of wood burns in a unique way.”





“

“I never had much success growing plants in my old beach house. Hopefully I can pick up a thing or two by watching you.  In this respect, you are the master and I only a humble apprentice.”





“

“When I behold thy wondrous face, a precious jewel of form and grace, my heart...torn by the dread of night, is purified with golden light. Poetry is the only way I can begin to describe my feelings for you.”





“

“You always smell so good after a hard day of work. It's your natural musk!”





“

“You smell sweet, my dear. Like a honeycomb drifting on a pool of spice tea.”





“

“Come here, let me massage your back. You look tense.”





“

“You smell sweet, my dear. Like a cinnamon leaf floating in the summer breeze.”





“

“My love...I wouldn't trade you for 100 iridium bars.
Nor 1000
...
Not even 10,000 bars, no.
...
No, not even 100,000 bars!
Wa...one million bars of pure iridium...? Don't make me do this...”

“

“The sound of rain, in some tiny way, reminds me of my cabin by the beach. The farm is wonderful, but I do miss the sound of the ocean.”





“

“I think I'll remain indoors today, my dear. The rain causes my hair to go limp.”





“

“My inspiration for writing is like the weather... It comes and goes at random. Today I feel entirely dull. Perhaps I'll read one of the classics to get my creative juices flowing.”





“

“The rain makes me think of my old life by the ocean. Change is part of life. That's okay.”


Giving coffee




“

“I got up early and made coffee. I find that a cup of this exquisite brew makes the early morning a lot more pleasant.”

“

“You're ice cold! Let me keep you warm.”





“

“My skill with words is unmatched, yet I can't find the way to properly describe your [allure/beauty].”





“

“What did I do today? I'll just say this... it takes a lot of work to maintain this rugged physique!”

“Sit down, relax! You've got to be tired after trudging through the mud all day.”

“

“I came to the valley to find the ivory tower from which my talents could reign supreme. But what I really found was a dungeon of loneliness. You saved me from that.”





“

“I feel burnt out in your absence. But when I hear that sound of muddy boots on wood, my heart rises from the ash.”





“

“I'm doing a walking meditation. It's good for creativity.”





“

“Be careful out there! I do worry about you sometimes. There are people in the world who would take advantage of you.”
