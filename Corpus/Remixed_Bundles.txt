Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

This page is about remixed bundles. For normal bundles, see Bundles.
When creating a new game, there is an option to remix the Community Center bundles. A room can have a mix of permanent and random bundles. Permanent bundles will always be present, though the items may vary slightly from their standard counterparts. Random bundles may or may not be present.
Where a bundle slot could be one of multiple items, all possible items will be displayed together in the same cell. Only one item will be present in the final bundle.

Bulletin Board
 Bulletin Board Before Completion
 Bulletin Board After Completion
The Bulletin Board appears after completing three bundles.
Completing all Bulletin Board bundles improves the player's friendship rating with every non-datable villager by two hearts (500 points).  Note that this applies only to non-datable villagers whom the player has met in person. Villagers who do not show on the "Social" tab of the player menu and villagers whose names appear as "???' will not receive 500 points. If the player completes all the bundles before Kent arrives on 1 Spring, Year 2 -- possible by buying a Red Cabbage from the Traveling Cart -- he will not benefit from the friendship increase, and will start at 0 hearts. The Dwarf's friendship will be unaffected if the player does not have the Dwarvish Translation Guide.
The morning after, Mayor Lewis will send a letter saying that packages containing items posted about "years ago" on the Community Center bulletin board have been appearing in villagers' homes.  He says the packages are all addressed from "your farm".  He expresses his gratitude and says "all of us in town are delighted!"
