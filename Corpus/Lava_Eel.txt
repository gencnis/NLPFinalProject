The Lava Eel is a fish that can be caught during all times and seasons in the Mines on the 100th floor and at the Volcano Caldera. It is the only fish that can spawn in lava.
In the Mines, the chances of hooking a Lava Eel depends on fishing level and on the fishing zone of the spot fished, increasing by 4% if a Curiosity Lure is equipped. For example, at level 10 fishing and fishing zone of 5, the chances of hooking a Lava Eel is 5.4%. With a Curiosity Lure equipped, this increases to 9.4%.[1]
At the Volcano Caldera, the percent chance of hooking a Lava Eel is equivalent to 10 times the fishing zone of the spot fished, assuming the 'Physics 101' painting was not caught. For example, there is a 50% chance to hook a Lava Eel if the bobber lands in a spot with a fishing zone of 5.[2]
Of the non-legendary fish, it is the fish with the highest sell price and the second most difficult fish to catch (after Octopus, tied with the Scorpion Carp).

Tailoring
Lava Eel is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the  Logo Cap. It can also be used as a red dye color at the dye pots in Emily's and Haley's house, located at 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Lava Eels can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 5 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. After the first quest is completed, the color of the pond water changes to red. The primary output is red Lava Eel Roe, but Gold Ore is possible starting at population 3 and several more valuable items are possible starting at population 9.

↑ See MineShaft::getFish in the game code. While Data\Fish.xnb suggests that a fishing level of 7 is needed to hook a Lava Eel, the data in MineShaft::getFish, which does not have any level conditions, overrides it. This means that there is no fishing level requirement to hook a Lava Eel.

↑ See Caldera::getFish in the game code.
