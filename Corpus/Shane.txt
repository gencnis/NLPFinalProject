“

“I'm renting my room from Marnie at a really good price. It's small but I can't complain. If I could reset my life maybe I'd start a chicken farm. Only free-range eggs of course.”


— Shane


Shane is a villager in Pelican Town who is often rude and unhappy, and suffers from depression and alcohol dependence. However, his attitude starts to change towards any player who chooses to befriend him. He works at JojaMart most days between 9am and 5pm unless the Community Center is completed, and frequently spends his evenings in The Stardrop Saloon. He doesn't work on the weekend except on rainy days, and is frequently around the ranch.
In the Social Status menu, Shane's outfit will change to a Joja Corporation uniform when he is at his job at JojaMart. He's one of the twelve characters available to marry.

Schedule
If it is raining, Shane will go to work at JojaMart on Saturdays or Sundays, if the Community Center is not complete. He will also go to work at JojaMart until the day after completing the Community Center.  Otherwise, he is usually found at The Stardrop Saloon in the evenings.
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Shane may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Shane will immediately go home to bed. Shane never visits the Resort on Festival days.
Shown below are Shane's schedules prioritized highest to lowest within each season. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

Hey,
         I thought it would be fun to send you a letter.  I don't really know what to write, though.
Here, I've enclosed a treat for you.  Don't tell anyone, but I snagged this from the back room of JojaMart ages ago.
Okay, see you soon.
-Shane


Two Hearts

Enter Cindersap Forest between 8pm and midnight.



Details 


Shane shares a beer with the player, on the dock of the pond, and describes his depression. He expresses optimism for the player's future and warns against drinking heavily.
Note: The beer consumed during the heart event will heal up to 50 Energy and 22 Health, and leave the player with the "Tipsy" buff.


Three Hearts

After reaching 3 hearts with Shane, he will send you a recipe in the mail.  He will also become slightly less rude to you during dialogues.

Pepper Poppers

I found this recipe in a magazine and I thought it sounded interesting. Feel free to give me a taste if you make it. hehe.- Shane


Four Hearts
After reaching four hearts with Shane, his dialogues with you will become more friendly.

Enter Marnie's Ranch at any time.



Details 


Shane is found passed out in his room, surrounded by empty beer cans. Marnie asks you to do something, so you use your watering can on his head to wake him up. Marnie remarks that all he does is mope around and drink beer. When Marnie asks him what his plans for the future are, Shane says that he hopes he "won't be around long enough to need a plan." Jas overhears and runs away crying; Marnie follows her while Shane falls to the ground and cries while apologizing.



Six Hearts

Enter Cindersap Forest between 9am and 8pm while storming or raining.



Details 


Shane is laying face down at the edge of the cliffs, again surrounded by empty beer cans. He tells you that he's miserable and asks you why he shouldn't just roll off the cliff. You can respond in four different ways:
"Because there's so much to live for!" (No effect on friendship.) "Maybe for you, but not for me! You're not going to understand... Just... go away. ...Ugh..."
"Jas needs you. You're like a father to her." (No effect on friendship.) "...You're right. Jas... Ugh, God... I'm a horrible, *hic*... selfish person. Now I feel even worse..."
"It would be a sin." (No effect on friendship.) "Yoba...? (Player), don't you know I'm an atheist? Ugh..."
"The decision is your own. Just know that I'm here for you." (No effect on friendship.) "Thanks... I appreciate that... I really do."
 
After that Shane suggests that you should take him to the hospital, in the next cutscene Harvey treats his physical ailments but is more concerned about Shane's mental health. He tells you that he's going to recommend Shane to a counselor in Zuzu City once he wakes up.
The next day, Shane will arrive at your farm to tell you that he intends to go to counselling. He also apologizes for the incident at the cliffs, to which you can respond in three different ways:

"I'm glad I was there to help." (+10 friendship.) "...Yeah, me too."
"You needed a serious wake-up call." (-10 friendship.) "I know... That's why I stopped by, to tell you about it."
"I'm just happy you're still here." (+10 friendship.) "Wow, it was that serious, huh? I can hardly remember..."

Seven Hearts I

Enter Marnie's Ranch while Shane is home after triggering Shane's six heart event.



Details 


Shane enters the ranch, where Marnie is standing behind the counter. He tells her that he's been feeling happier than usual. Jokingly, she asks if there was a sale on beer. Though slightly annoyed, he responds by saying he's started drinking sparkling water instead. He then says that he's realized that he has people that he can rely on and that doing so doesn't make him weak. He walks over to Jas, who is in the kitchen, and gives her a present. She opens it to find a pair of expensive shoes that she had wanted. When she asks Shane how he could afford it, he replies that it's because he cut back on his expensive habit of drinking beer.

Seven Hearts II

Enter the town between 10am and 4pm on a sunny day. (Also requires 2 hearts with both Emily and Clint.)



Details 


You will find Shane filming a scene starring Emily and Clint. Shane will explain to you that Joja is holding a contest to create an advertisement for the newest Joja Cola, and the winner gets 10,000g. He will ask you to walk behind Clint and Emily as they act so the scene feels more natural. When it's over, he will thank you for helping him.
* This event was Shane's six heart event before update 1.1.


Seven Hearts III

After reaching 7 hearts with Shane, he will send you a recipe in the mail.

Strange Bun

Eight Hearts

Enter Marnie's Ranch while Shane is home.



Details 


When you enter the ranch, Jas leads you through the door in the kitchen that is normally locked. Inside, Shane is painting a sign that says "Fresh Eggs." He's surrounded by his flock of special blue chickens and his favorite white chicken, Charlie. Once he finishes painting the sign, he picks up Charlie and briefly talks to her about his ambitions and his struggles. When you and Jas enter the room, Shane talks to you a bit about how he is trying to pass on the chicken knowledge to Jas so she can continue the tradition if he ever moves out.

After seeing this event, each chicken that the player purchases from Marnie and each egg that hatches in the incubator now has a 25% chance of being blue. Aside from appearance, the blue chickens are identical to white chickens.


Ten Hearts

Exit your house before 6:30am to initiate the event, then walk to the Bus Stop between 4pm and 6pm.



Details 


Shane invites you to go see the Zuzu City Tunnelers (a gridball team) play in their stadium in Zuzu City. You take a bus into the city together and the scene changes to a grimy stadium with you and Shane in the stands. While cheering on the Tunnelers, Shane thanks you for sticking with him through his struggle with depression and anxiety. He then asks you what you think of your first gridball game:
"Noisy... It makes me appreciate how peaceful it is back home." (No effect on friendship.) "Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense. Me? I get bored with Pelican Town sometimes. But... I like that you're different. We balance each other out."
"Fun... Pelican Town seems really boring in comparison." (No effect on friendship.) "Oh really? I'm surprised... Didn't you move to Stardew Valley to escape the noise of the city? I mean... Don't get me wrong, I totally understand. My life in Pelican Town is pretty bland, you know."
His attention returns to the game when the Tunnelers make a play and score a goal. In a moment of excitement, Shane gives you a kiss, but then he feels embarrassed by it and apologizes for getting carried away. After a pause, you reply with a kiss and allay his fears. The scene pans to the northwest and fades and Shane briefly reflects on the evening.


Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelors, raised friendship with each bachelor to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelor's 10-heart event, then entering The Stardrop Saloon will trigger a cutscene. If Alex is the final bachelor you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a friendly game of pool.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelors will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelors will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelors will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Enter town on a non-Friday between 8am and 5pm. For parts II and III enter town anytime each of the next two days.



Details 


On the first day, Marnie, Jas, and yourself are outside of the saloon. Shane comes out of the bar, saying that he hasn't had a session like that in a while. Marnie looks worried, and asks you to talk to him next time he comes out of the saloon.
On the second day, Shane comes out and you confront him. Shane gets upset at the suggestion that he's been drinking, and runs home.
On the third day, Marnie and you are waiting outside the saloon, and Shane goes in. You try to catch him in the act of drinking, but he is instead standing in front of an arcade machine. Marnie is confused and asks about the cans on the floor, and Shane explains that they're Joja Cola cans. He also explains that playing video games helps him calm the urge to drink.

"I'm sorry, I should've believed you."  (No effect on friendship.) That's alright, (Player). You're just looking out for me. I get it. Look... I know I haven't been perfect... but, I'm trying my best... and I'm gonna keep trying. So you don't have to worry about me. My life is better now than it's ever been. I'm not in such a dark place anymore...
"I was worried!"  (No effect on friendship.)
Afterwards, Shane will say that you and Marnie must have been confused to see him in front of the arcade machine.


Marriage
Main article: Marriage
Once married, Shane will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a small chicken coop behind the farmhouse, where he'll sometimes go to visit with his chicken "Charlie".
On rainy days, Shane may offer you Beer, Large Egg, Pale Ale, Void Egg, or Pepper Poppers.  On days when Shane stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you Omelet, Pepper Poppers, or Pizza.

“Hi, [Player]. I've actually been having a pretty good day so far.”


When given the Mermaid's Pendant




“

“...!!! I accept!! ... I'll set everything up. We'll have the ceremony in 3 days, okay?”


When engaged




“

“Part of me is wondering if this isn't all some elaborate prank. I can't believe you'd actually want to marry someone like me.”





“

“[Player]... My head's spinning, and I haven't even had a beer yet.”


After Group 10 Heart Event




“

“(Shane has a glazed look in his eye. He won't speak to you.)”





“

“I don't understand you... *sigh*...”






Events

Year 2+



“

“Some of these eggs were laid just this morning. See? They're still warm!”


Flower Dance




“

“Mmm... excellent sauce. *slurp* Ah, this green stuff is spicy! *munch* *crunch* ...ow.”


(asked to be dance partner, refused request.)




“

“...No.”


The Luau




“

“Wow... you don't get hot pepper chutney like this in the big city...”


Dance of the Moonlight Jellies




“

“The jellies were here a year ago, and they'll be back a year from now... Nature is amazing.”


Stardew Valley Fair




“

“All these animals are friendly and love to get massaged.”


Spirit's Eve




“

“Why is there no more pumpkin ale?”


Festival of Ice




“

“If it was up to me, I'd probably have a pizza festival at the saloon, instead...”


Feast of the Winter Star




“

“I've met some people who believe in spirits, and magic... but me? I've never seen anything that couldn't be explained by science.”






After Marriage 



Indoor Days




“

“Buh... sometimes life feels like a slow, gray blur... know what I mean?”





“

“Do me a favor... when I pass away, use my dust to fertilize some corn for the hens.”





“

“*smooch*... Mmm, it tastes like someone's been nibbling on pizza rolls.”





“

“I may keep to myself a lot, and I may seem unhappy sometimes... but I do appreciate all the work you do. I'm a lucky guy.”





“

“There's something special in the air... *sniff*... what is that? Oh... It's just this old corn chip I put in my pocket a few weeks ago. *crunch*”





“

“I got up early and fed all the farm animals. I hope that makes your job a little easier today. I also filled <pet's name> water bowl.”





“

“I spent the morning repairing a few of the fences. They should be as good as new.”


In his side room




“

“Beer or cider? Sometimes life can be challenging. Hi, [Player]. I'll just hang out in here today and uh... maybe sweep the floor a little bit or something.”


Giving food




“

“Hey. Take this... I put a bit too much in the microwave. Sorry if it's squishy.”


Outdoor Days




“

“I didn't sleep well last night so I'm hoping this fresh air will help get the juices flowing. What juices, you ask? Heh... you're weird.”





“

“Sometimes I stop and realize that I'm nothing more than a bag of juicy, squishy flesh. But hey... that's just fine... what's life, anyway?”





“

“When I stop and think about it... I'm in a good place. My life is pretty nice.”





“

“Ooohh... my tongue is swollen from eating too many pepper poppers.”





“

“Hey, [Player]. You were sleeping like a baby so I slipped out of bed and went for a morning walk around the farm. Everything looks fine.”





“

“I dunno if my lungs can handle this freshness. I'm still used to JojaAir.”


By his chicken coop




“

“Charlie's doing well.”


Standing by river




“

“Don't worry, this is only Joja Cola.”


Indoor Nights




“

“I'm just gonna have a couple more beers before closing my eyes for the night.”





“

“If... If only... ah, I was just thinking back on the glory days, when I played gridball on the varsity team. Now I'm old and weak, though...”





“

“Ughh... *gurgle*... I feel a little bloated... oof... too much Joja all-purpose dipping sauce.”





“

“Buh... I wish I was six inches taller and a whole lot smarter... You like me for who I am? I still have a hard time understanding that...”





“

“I spent all day watching TV and now my legs feel like soft dough. Guess I'll have to take it easy until tomorrow.”





“

“How was your day? Mine actually went pretty well.”


Rainy Days




“

“I hope Jas and Marnie are doing alright without me. I'm not too worried... Jas is old enough now to take care of the animals on her own.”





“

“You know what? I think I've lost some weight since moving in with you.”





“

“Buhh... I don't feel like being productive today.”





“

“[Player], should I do something useful today?... or just nap forever?”





“

“The roof's leaking? Ah well... a little mold never hurt anyone.”


Giving food




“

“Here... take this. I bought some of those a while ago and they're almost expired...”


Rainy Nights




“

“Hmm... seems like a good night to microwave a few pizza rolls. Some people like to cook them in the oven, but it just takes too long for me. Plus I like that squishy texture.”





“

“The tip-tappa-tip of the rain takes me to a different time... a different place.”





“

“I guess... if I had some pants I might've gone outside today... but, nah.”





“

“I like gloomy weather, but I feel kinda bad for the hens.”





“

“Tip-tappa-tip-tappa-tip... I'm starting to feel thirsty.”





“

“I just got off the phone with Jas and Marnie. They seem to be having a pretty good time without me.”


After receiving the Stardrop from Shane




“

“Honey... I wanted to give you that fruit as a symbol of my love.”


High Hearts




“

“*Sniff*... *sniff*... mmm... what's that wonderful fragrance you're wearing? Eau de pepperoni?”





“

“You're a lot better-looking than me, you know that?”





“

“The name 'Shane' means 'Gift from Yoba'... What a joke.”





“

“I'm in a great mood today... The Tunnelers won big last night.”





“

“Hey, if I ever seem cranky, just ignore it. I get in weird moods sometimes, but it's not about you... okay?”





“

“Ah...life on the farm sure beats working at Joja. That place was disgusting. You thought it was depressing out front? Kid, you should see the backroom...”





“

“Ah... this is the life. No responsibilities, Tunnelers game tonight, fridge stocked with all the goodies a guy could need.”





“

“I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.”





“

“Huh... You're wondering why I have this goofy grin on my face? You really have a short memory span, don't you? *blush*”


Neutral Hearts




“

“Oh, do you need something from me? Sorry, I'm kind of busy at the moment.”





“

“Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now...”





“

“Working at Joja was a drag, but at least I got to interact with people occasionally.”





“

“What, you want me to clean the dishes? I'll do it... eventually...”





“

“Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to go back to working at Joja.”





“

“If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I'm happy in the company of the TV and a couple of tall boys.”





“

“Ugh... clean, clean, clean. Sweep, sweep, sweep. Bathe. Cook. Make the bed... Oh, well. Life's alright.”


Low Hearts




“

“Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?”





“

“What do you want? You sound like Marnie on one of her bad days. Go away.”





“

“Farm-life is actually really boring. What am I doing here?”





“

“Yeah... *hic* ... Sure, honey. Whatever you say... *hic*”





“

“*grumble*... chores...”





“

“What... you want me to clean? Make you a sandwich? *sigh*...”





“

“*sigh*... I just want to stay in bed.”





“

“I just don't feel like getting up today.”





“

“Nnnghh...what is it? Make your own breakfast.”





“

“Nghh... what is it? I'm trying to sleep.”


After giving another marriage candidate a gift (random chance)




“

“So...I heard you secretly gave [CharacterName] a gift today...Do I have to be suspicious of you?”


Going Out




“

“I'm going out today, alright?”


Visiting Jas in the forest




“

“I'm attached to these woods... lots of memories...”


At home




“

“Sorry if I'm sweaty... That was quite a walk... Buh, I'm out of shape.”


Friday night, at the saloon




“

“If I don't order a cold one now and then, Gus will go out of business. I'm just doing my civic duty. I'll head home around 10.”


Shopping at Pierre's




“

“Hmm... I have to say, JojaMart has a much better selection of frozen dinners.”


During pregnancy




“

“[Term of endearment], can't you tell? You're pregnant.”


After having one child




“

“It's weird, when I was younger I swore I'd never have a kid. I wonder what happened to me?”





“

“Let's make sure to give [child] lots of eggs... Baby's gotta grow those legs!”





“

“Papa Shane reporting for duty... Buh... I've become corny in my old age.”


After having two children




“

“I already fed the kids two bowls of pizza puffs cereal. They'll be full for a while.”





“

“I'll be honest... two kids is enough for me.”





“

“Ugh... [child] is being a little brat today. Must've gotten that from me...”





“

“*Sigh*... If only we could send the kids off to Joja work-camp for a season... I'm just kidding.”



Spring




“

“Maybe I'll learn a new skill this year...”


Spring 1




“

“Ooo... my throbbing head. How many did I have last night?”


Day before the Egg Festival




“

“The egg festival is probably my favorite... you know how I am, I go crazy for anything to do with chickens.”


Day before the Flower Dance




“

“Oh, right. It's the flower dance tomorrow. Hey, if it makes you happy, I'm happy.”


Summer




“

“What's on my agenda today... hmmm...  I think I see some spicy pretzel snacks and a couple of 'cold boys' on the horizon.”


Summer 1




“

“I like seeing all the tropical plants this time of year. The valley gets so lush.”


Day before the Luau

“I might fast until the luau tomorrow. I need the ol' bag to be empty so I can fill it with piping hot soup.”


Summer 27




“

“What are your plans for the fall? I'm going to try and incorporate more wine into my diet.”


Fall

“I think there might be a new species of fungus growing behind my mini-fridge. Ah well, 'tis the season, right?”


Fall 1




“

“Hmm... I might have to buy a few cases of pumpkin ale to celebrate the season...”


Day before the Stardew Valley Fair




“

“I'll be helping Marnie with the animals at tomorrow's fair, like usual. You should just kick back and have some fun.”


Fall 17




“

“I'm starting to really feel my age... and I'm not comfortable with that at all.”


Winter




“

“There's a wide, wide world out there... but I'd rather stay in my room.”


Winter 1




“

“Any big plans this winter? I'll probably end up watching a lot of TV and just hanging out around the house.”


Winter 28




“

“Well, another year gone by... I look a little older, but that's about all.”


Special Summit Cutscene Dialogue




“

“If I hadn't met you, [Player]... I might not even be here right now. Which would be a shame, because the bird-watching up here is phenomenal! Heh... I... I tend to joke a lot, because...well... I guess keeping things light-hearted makes it so I don't have to open up and make myself vulnerable. But every season that goes by, with you, I get a little more comfortable with myself. Uh.. I guess what I want to say is... I have no regrets marrying you!”


After Divorce




“

“...
...Leave me alone.”

Portraits








































































Timeline
Shane's look evolved over the years the game was in development.
Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Shane's style changed over the years before the game was launched.


Trivia
Judging by the 'Mega Station' console in Shane's bedroom, he is a gamer. Additionally, it is hooked up to a 'Code Sultan XL'.
During Shane's second seven heart event, Clint says that "Joja Cola has three times the sorbitol for a thick, sweet, blast." The joke is that sorbitol is a thick, slightly sweet substance that when consumed in large quantities can cause gastrointestinal distress, with symptoms such as gas and diarrhea (both of which could be considered a "blast.")
When married, he'll admit to wishing "that he was six inches taller".
When comparing the male sprites to each other during the Flower Dance cutscene, Shane is relatively shorter.
He used to play for his high school's varsity gridball team.
In Secret Note #7, it is confirmed that he is one of three 'older bachelors' in Pelican Town.
Shane's original shirt appears to be based on a Seattle Sounders soccer jersey.
Even though he gives you the recipe for a Strange Bun, it is still a hated gift to him.
