“

“Leah lives alone in a small cabin just outside of town. She loves to spend time outside, foraging for a wild meal or simply enjoying the gifts of the season. She’s a talented artist with a large portfolio of work… yet she’s too nervous to display it to the public. Maybe you can give her a little confidence boost?”


— Dev Update #12


Leah is a villager who lives in a small cottage outside Pelican Town. She's one of the twelve characters available to marry. 
She spends each morning sculpting inside her cottage. Her home opens at 10am and closes at 6pm, but during Spring, Summer, or Fall, players must first acquire two hearts of friendship before being allowed inside. Players at any friendship level may enter during Winter between 10am and 6pm.

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Leah may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Leah will immediately go home to bed. Leah never visits the Resort on Festival days or her checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.

Heart Events
Two Hearts

Enter Leah's Cottage when she's there.



Details 


You see her working on a sculpture. She discusses sculpting with you, and says "Once you get past the outer layers, the true nature starts to show..."
"It's the same with people." (No effect on friendship.) she agrees and says "Oh! yeah, that's absolutely right!"
"I actually prefer the look of raw, unadulterated wood." (No effect on friendship.) She says that there's nothing wrong with that and that she thinks there's lots of beauty to be found in raw untouched nature. She goes on to say as a human, she is interested in how we shape and interpret the world around us, she explains this as she is interested in 'art'.
"(creepy) May I have a kiss?" (-100 friendship.)
If the farmer is male, she calls you a pig, punches you and kicks you out. The scene ends.
Otherwise, she acts surprised, saying "Oh! you're...? (blushing) Me too. That's good to know". Regardless of her blushing, she will hit you with her hammer and kick you out. The scene ends.
WARNING: if you choose this option, you can never see Leah's 8-Heart event. Because you were creepy and missed the chance to make a suggestion for her art career, it will not be possible to trigger either version of her 8-Heart event in the future.
She continues, "Although, I have to admit... It's not easy to pay the bills as an artist."

"Why don't you have an art show in town?" (No effect on friendship.) She muses that it could help make Pelican Town a true art destination, but says she'd be crushed if nobody liked her sculptures. She says she'll think about it, and thanks you for stopping by.
"Why don't you sell your art on the internet?" (No effect on friendship.) She notes that she would need a computer for that, but that they are expensive. She says she'll think about it, and thanks you for stopping by.

Four Hearts

Enter Leah's Cottage when she's there.



Details 


You see her arguing with her ex-partner on the phone, who is asking her to come back to the city she left. After the call, she tells you her story and asks if it was selfish to move out of the city to be an artist.
"No, it had to be done." (No effect on friendship.) Leah responds, "You're right... I just wouldn't have been happy back there."
"No, and your ex sounds like an idiot." (No effect on friendship.) Leah responds, "That's a bit harsh... But yeah, we had different priorities."
"No, but you would've been better off staying in the city." (-20 friendship.)
"Yeah, a little." (-20 friendship.)
"Yeah, but it's natural to care about yourself first." (-20 friendship.)
Depending on your response in this conversation and the two-heart event, she'll either thank you for listening or briefly get angry. She tells you that she's been thinking about the art show or is saving for a computer, depending on your choice in the previous event.


Six Hearts I

Leah is at your farmhouse door on any day but rainy between 6 AM and 11:30 AM.



Details 


Leah says she has a gift for you, and you receive the sculpture she's been working on. It's called How I Feel About <your name>.

Six Hearts II

Enter Cindersap Forest when Leah is there, in any season except winter.



Details 


Leah is trying to reach a fruit from the large tree above the forest lake. She can't reach it, so you lift her onto your shoulders. She thanks you and says that if her art ever fails, you'll always be there to catch her.



Eight Hearts
Art Show

If you suggested an art show in her two-heart event, Leah is at your farmhouse door between 6 AM and 8 AM (except in winter) to invite you to her art show. Enter Pelican Town between 3 PM and 5 PM (not necessarily the same day).



Details 


You arrive to find many others already present. Leah is happy to see you and nervously starts the art show. She thanks everyone for coming. Leah says she came to Pelican Town to draw inspiration from the beautiful surroundings and confesses that it really feels like home now. She presents her sculptures.
"I haven't named this one, yet. She started out as an exercise in human anatomy, but I ended up seeing her through to completion. Her expression is intentionally unclear... is she embarrassed, amused, pained? I'll leave that for you to decide." (pause) "This one's called 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace'. It represents the boundary of human imagination. The shape and color came to me vividly when I was in a 'trance state'." (pause) "I've been calling this one 'Egg Heads'. I wanted to create an animatronic humanoid statue to toy with the viewer's ability to properly attribute personhood to a physical entity." (pause) "And the last one is called 'Wood Sculpture 3'. It's a celebration of my favorite sculpting material... wood."
Finally, she thanks her special friend (you), who gave her the idea for the art show and the courage to go through with it.
The villagers all praise Leah and her artwork:

Lewis: "I'm proud of you, Leah! Events like this really breathe life into our little town!"
Gus: "Great stuff!"
Demetrius: "I love your art, Leah! 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace' is my favorite."
Robin: "Great use of wood!"
Penny: "Thanks for doing this!"
Leah thanks everyone, Lewis starts the bidding on the art pieces, and as the scene fades, her ex, Kel, can be seen to the side. Afterward, Leah says she's exhausted but that the show was a success.


Art Website

If you suggested an art website in her two-heart event, enter Leah's Cottage when she's there.



Details 


Leah proudly tells you she bought a laptop and set up an online art shop like you suggested. Her computer plays a coin sound, and she excitedly says that means someone just bought something. She pauses and says there's a "Mr K" who keeps buying all her sculptures. She figures it must be "some rich guy" who loves her art. She thanks you for the idea and says it's been really successful so far, and is confident she'll have enough money to work on her art full-time now. She goes back to work on her store, tweaking the CSS sheets.

Ten Hearts

Enter Cindersap Forest between 11 AM and 4 PM, in any season except winter.



Details 


Leah says she knew you'd be passing through the forest, and surprises you with a picnic. She thanks you for helping her get one step closer to being a real artist, and you share a kiss.
 KelLeah's ex-partner Kel comes out of the bushes. (Kel will be male or female depending on your player character's gender.) Leah is annoyed and asks "What the heck are you doing here?"
If you suggested the art website, Kel says "I found your online art store... weren't you wondering about the 'Mr. K' who kept buying all your sculptures?" Leah is disappointed, because she thought it was "just a rich guy" who truly loved her art. Kel says she was "half right", implying that Kel doesn't care about her art. Kel says "I want you back. I miss you." Leah refuses, saying Kel was never interested in her art until she became successful.
If you suggested the art show, Kel says "I came all the way from Zuzu City to see your sculptures. ...And to get you to come back with me." Kel claims to want their relationship to be the way it was before. Leah refuses, saying Kel was never interested in her art until she became successful.
Either way, an argument ensues. You can choose to "Punch Kel in the face" or "Try reasoning with Kel". If you don't punch Kel, Leah does instead. If you do punch Kel, Leah says that Kel is fine but "That was pretty violent, (Name)."
Leah takes you to find a more secluded spot and admits the picnic didn't quite pan out like she'd wanted it to.


Group Ten-Heart Event

If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelorettes, raised friendship with each bachelorette to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelorette's 10-heart event, then entering Haley/Emily's House will trigger a cutscene. If Haley is the final bachelorette you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a gossip session about Mayor Lewis and Marnie's relationship.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelorettes will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelorettes will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelorettes will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Exit the farmhouse between 6am and 8:20am on a sunny day that isn't Sunday and isn't in winter.



Details 


Leah meets the player outside the farmhouse in the morning.
Part 2: The next sunny day (or any sunny day after that), enter the Forest between 11:30 am and 2:00pm.
Leah has asked you to paint a portrait of Marnie with her.
Leah asks you what style of portrait she should paint. "Hey, <your name>... what style do you think I should do? I'm up for anything..."

Classic country portrait (No effect on friendship.)
Colorful, retro pop-art (No effect on friendship.)
Minimalist modern (No effect on friendship.)
Leah shows you her painting, which is different depending on which option you picked. (Left to right: "Classic country portrait", "Colorful, retro pop-art", "Minimalist modern")

You display your painting as well, which is less than flattering. 

Leah tells Marnie that she can keep both paintings, but Marnie says that you should keep your first painting - and only takes Leah's.
The sequence ends, and you now have My First Painting in your inventory. Leah's painting will also appear in Marnie's bedroom.


Marriage
Main article: Marriage
Once married, Leah will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, she will add her own room to the right of the bedroom. She'll also set up a small area behind the farmhouse where she'll sometimes go to work on a sculpture.
On rainy mornings, Leah may offer you a gift she found while "mushroom-hunting":  Chanterelle, Common Mushroom, Red Mushroom, or Morel.  On mornings when Leah stays indoors all day, she may offer you Coffee or a gift grown in "a little pot out back":  Wild Horseradish, Daffodil, Leek, Dandelion, Cactus Fruit, Fiddlehead Fern, Spice Berry, or Sweet Pea.  She may also offer you a Salad on days when she stays indoors all day.  On New Years' Eve (Winter 28), she'll give you a bottle of Wine.

“

“The view from this window is inspiring, don't you think?”


Giving food




“

“Good morning, [Player]. I've planted these in a little pot out back... I grew that with great love and attention. Enjoy it.”





“

“I was thinking... life's too short to eat bad food. Luckily, we live in one of the best regions for fresh greens and vegetables! Here, I made you a healthy salad. I'm surprised you aren't sick of my salad yet!”





“

“Good morning, [Player]! I made us some coffee. My morning just wouldn't be complete without a hot cup of coffee.”


Outdoor Days




“

“The cool breeze feels nice. It reminds me of living by the river.”





“

“Hmm... I'm going to do some maintenance over here. I just get the urge to do some hammering now and then.”





“

“It's going to be a special day, I can sense it.”





“

“Ah... that smell of fresh dirt. There's nothing quite like it. You can just tell the air is clean here... it feels good in the lungs.”

Rainy Days

“The trees have been begging for this rain... I'm happy for them.”





“

“Might want to do some fishing or mining today, huh?”


Giving mushroom




“

“Good morning! I got up early and did some mushroom hunting. Here, take one. Searching for mushrooms is like going on a treasure hunt. It's a lot of fun.”


Rainy Nights




“

“How was your day? Did you see any animals out there?”





“

“I usually go for salad, but a wet night like this gives me cravings for hot soup.”





“

“It's going to be relaxing to fall asleep on a night like this...”





“

“I made a little wood sculpture today, but it was so ugly I threw it into the fire. I think to become a great artist, you have to be critical of your own work.”





“

“I'm glad you're home... It's a good night to get under the covers and stay warm.”





“

“How was your day today, dear? Muddy?”


Going Out




“

“I'm going to take a nature walk today. I need to get out of the house.”

High Hearts




“

“Living here, I feel like I'm on the summit of a great mountain.”





“

“Did I ever tell you... when you first moved here I had a dream that we'd be together someday.”





“

“Sometimes it's hard not to believe in destiny... the fact that I decided to move here, and that we found each other. It could've gone entirely differently at any point.”





“

“Wow, you look [full of energy/beautiful] today!”





“

“Mmm... You smell nice today.”





“

“I was just admiring my wedding amulet... I'll cherish this treasure for the rest of my life.”


Neutral Hearts




“

“I wonder who lived here before us?”





“

“Don't you have anything to do today?”

“I'm thankful for our simple life on the farm.”
