“I wanna be just like my big brother when I grow up!”


— Vincent


Vincent is a villager who lives in the southern part of Pelican Town.  He's a young boy, and can often be found with his best friend Jas. He looks up to his brother Sam and wants to be just like him when he grows up.

Schedule
On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday in Spring, Fall, and Winter, Vincent and Jas spend the afternoon with Penny being tutored at the museum. During Summer, Vincent is often at the beach.
Vincent won't leave his home on days when it's raining, unless it's Spring 11, when he visits Harvey's Clinic.
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Vincent may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Vincent will immediately go home to bed. Vincent never visits the Resort on Festival days or his checkup day at Harvey's Clinic. Vincent also never visits the Resort without an adult accompanying him.
