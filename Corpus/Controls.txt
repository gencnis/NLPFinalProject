Object Placement Tips
One of the most useful controls is the  Right Stick.  It can be used to exactly place furniture, rugs, windows, etc. where you want them. It's pretty sensitive but absolutely required especially for placing windows.
While moving a rug into place using the  Right Stick, use  to Rotate the rug.
Toolbar Tips
To "power-up" tools such as the Watering Can (i.e., act on multiple tiles at once), press and hold .
Interacting with villagers with any item other than tools will gift that item to the villager.
Inventory Tips
When moving inventory, the  button will move one item at a time or hold to move multiple.
Pressing  after selecting an item(s) from your inventory will move it to the trash icon.
Pressing  while in your inventory will quickly organize items.
Pressing both  and  while purchasing items from any shop will allow the player to purchase items twice as fast.
Weapons
Pressing  performs basic attack while pressing  performs block or alternate attack.
History
1.4: Removed "new" input from button press until the button is released.  This makes harvesting large numbers of kegs/preserves jars/crystalariums, etc. easier by holding the button without releasing it.  Added option to shift toolbar (active inventory bar) to PC.  Added emotes menu.
1.5.5: Holding Control + Shift now lets you purchase or craft stacks of 25 items at a time.
