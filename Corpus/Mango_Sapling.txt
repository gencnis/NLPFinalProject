The Mango Sapling is a Fruit Tree sapling that takes 28 days to grow into a Mango Tree, after which it will produce one fruit each day during the Summer, or year-round on Ginger Island. Like all Fruit Trees, it will also produce fruit all year round if planted in the Greenhouse.
It can be purchased from the Island Trader in exchange for 75 Mussels. Mango Saplings can sometimes be found by breaking open a Golden Coconut. Professor Snail gives a Mango Sapling as a reward for completing the Snake collection in the Island Field Office. They also have a 0.5% chance to drop from Tiger Slimes.
