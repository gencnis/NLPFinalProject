Dust Sprites are an enemy found in the Mines in the frozen floors. Dust Sprites are a great source of coal, as it is one of their most common drops. 500 Dust Sprites (any type) need to be killed for the Monster Eradication Goal at the Adventurer's Guild.

Behavior
Dust Sprites are small creatures which often travel in packs. They bounce in place and chirp while inactive. If they spot the player, dust sprites will bound after them, causing damage upon collision.  Occasionally, they will break a rock that is in their way.

Strategy
Simply hit them. Cornering them against a wall will keep them from being knocked out of range with repeated swinging or stabbing.  Because of their bouncy behavior, it's easy for them to be closer than expected.

Respawning
Traveling to the entrance to the Mines will reset all floors.  Repeatedly farming frozen levels of the Mines, then exiting the mines will allow for repeated farming of Dust Sprites.

Trivia
The Dust Sprites may be a reference to the Soot Sprites from Studio Ghibli's animated films "Spirited Away" and "My Neighbor Totoro".
The Dust Sprite's name in data files is "Dust Spirit".  This can be seen in-game during the cutscene at The Summit. It is also listed as "Dust Spirit" in Clint's Special Orders Quest.
Players get Mining experience points for any rocks that are broken by Dust Sprites. This is the case even in Multiplayer where every player will get the experience for the rock broken, even if they weren't in the mines at the time.
