Buildings
Robin has a few new buildings available for sale.
Shed: an empty room which players can do whatever they like with. They can decorate it the same way as their house.
Mill: lets players place wheat in it to make flour, or beets to make sugar. One wheat makes one flour. One beet makes 3 sugars. When they place wheat or beets inside, the flour or sugar will be ready the next morning. The little box on the right side of the mill acts like a chest and it will contain any product that has been milled the previous day.
The wizard now offers new farm buildings after completing a quest line. These buildings are very expensive and intended for end-game. They'll appear instantly after purchase, unlike Robin's buildings which require construction.
Junimo Hut: Junimos will come out to harvest any mature crops within a certain distance of the hut. The junimos will place the crops they harvest in the hut for players to grab at their leisure.
Water Obelisk: when interacted with, it warps players to the beach, exactly like the beach warp totem. It's basically an infinite totem that lives on the farm.

Farm maps
There are now five farm maps to choose from when starting a new game. The basic map that exists currently, as well as a new map themed around each "skill". Each special map has a feature that makes it a little different, and each map also comes with unique decorations inside the players house.
Riverlands: lots of water on this map... limiting your farm space. Looks nice. Fishing is actually viable on this farm... In fact, players can catch the same fish that are available in town.
Forest: the forest encroaches on the land, limiting farming space. However, there are renewable stumps on the east edge of the map, and seasonal forage items spawn there as well. Also, there is a new type of "weed" that spawns on the farm, which looks unique and will always drop mixed seeds when cut.
Hill-Top: lots of cliffs... and there is a special mining area in the southwest where ore will spawn, as well as unique geode-bearing stones.
Wilderness: lots of space to farm, looks a little more interesting than the basic farm with a large lake in the southwest corner, and a cliff along the east and south. On this map, Bats and golems will come out at night. There is a new monster called a Wilderness Golem which is unique to this map. It behaves just like the stone golem, but has different drops. Its stats scale with player combat level.
Farm

Added a new farmhouse upgrade which adds a cellar.

After divorce, ex-spouses are less friendly toward the player and have unique 'rejected' dialogue.
Using the Dark Shrine of Memory in the Witch's Hut will erase the ex-spouses memory, making it seem like you had never been married.

Inside a new building, the Witch's Hut there are three new shrines:
Dark Shrine of Memory - Will erase a divorced spouse's memory, making it seem like you had never been married.
Dark Shrine of Selfishness - Allows you to turn your children into doves (Gets rid of them) in exchange for a Prismatic Shard.
Dark Shrine of Night Terrors - Allows you to toggle having monsters spawn on your farm in exchange for a Strange Bun.
There are two new quests available which unlock the new Wizard farm buildings (available after completing either the Community Center or JojaMart goals).
