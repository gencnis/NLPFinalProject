The Void Egg is an animal product obtained from a Void Chicken.  Initially, a Void Egg can be obtained through a random event involving a witch.  The random event can occur as long as the player owns a Big or Deluxe Coop that is not full. The witch will fly over the coop during the night and leave a Void Egg inside.
A Void Egg can also be purchased from Krobus for 5,000g.  If the player is married to Shane, there is a chance he may present them with one as a gift on rainy days.  A Void Salmon Fish Pond may produce a Void Egg when the population of the pond reaches 9.
A Void Egg sells for a base of 65g. This is 15g more than a Small Egg, but 30g less than a Large Egg.
A Void Egg can hatch a Void Chicken by placing it in a Big or Deluxe Coop's incubator.
A Void Egg will be produced by a Void Chicken daily if fed on the prior day, like all other chickens.
