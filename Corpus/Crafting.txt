Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

 For food items prepared in the kitchen, see Cooking.
Crafting is the activity of creating a new item as specified by a crafting recipe. Similar to but separate from Cooking, each recipe lists a set of ingredient items that are consumed in each crafting action. The player knows ten crafting recipes at the start of the game, and must learn all others by gaining skills, developing friendships with townsfolk, and purchasing the rest from shops. Unlike cooked items, most (not all) crafted items are inedible.
The Crafting menu can be accessed by pausing the game (using E/ESC on PC,  on Switch,  on Xbox,  on PlayStation) and navigating to the tab with a hammer icon. The recipes the player knows will be saturated, while recipes with missing ingredients are faded grey. 
By mousing over each item, a popup shows the materials that you will need. Ingredient names written in red text are not currently in the player's inventory.
To craft an item, click on the item's icon once you have all the required ingredients. The newly crafted item will appear beneath the player's cursor, and the player can then place it inside their inventory. The crafting screen may expand to multiple pages once the player acquires a larger selection of recipes.
Crafting recipes are gained by leveling up any skills, purchased from merchants, or received as gifts by gaining friendship points with villagers.

Fences
Fences block players, farm animals, and the spread of grass. The different fence types differ only in appearance and durability.
Fences will decay over time. When freshly placed, they'll drop the item when demolished. Otherwise they'll not drop an item, and will eventually become visibly damaged. Fences will disappear entirely if left in a damaged state for too long. A shortcut to replacing a damaged fence (other than hitting it with a tool and then replacing it) is to "use" the broken fence while a new fence is equipped in inventory. Your spouse may fix some broken-state fences daily before you leave the house.
Gates can be used to pass through fences, and closed to keep livestock (and other ground-pathing entities) contained. Torches can be placed on a fence.
Having a Gold Clock on the farm will prevent fences from decaying.

Artisan Equipment
Artisan Equipment is used to make Artisan Goods. Each device makes a specific set of goods, and can craft only one item at a time.  Increased production requires multiple devices.
As with furnaces and all other equipment, the artisan good must be collected from the device before it can be used again.

Fertilizer
Main article: Fertilizer
Fertilizer is used for boosting production on your farm. It may retain water, increase chance of better quality crops, or speed crop growth.  Some types of fertilizer must be used before a seed sprouts, and others may be used at any time.  Only one type of fertilizer can be used on each tilled plot at any time.
Note:  Each craft of Speed-Gro or Deluxe Speed-Gro produces 5 fertilizer.  Each craft of Quality Retaining Soil produces 2 fertilizer.  The rest produce 1 each.

Alternatively, users with access to their saved game files may find the "Stardew Checkup" utility helpful for tracking their Crafting achievement progress.  The utility is located at:  https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-checkup/

Crafted goods outside the farm
It is possible to place chests and other crafted items outside the farm.  Chests are useful for storing gifts close to the homes of Villagers who prefer them or to allow additional storage when Mining, Fishing, or Foraging.  Worm Bins can be placed near fishing spots, Furnaces can be placed at the entrance to The Mines, and entire sections of the Valley may be utilized for Keg or Preserves Jar processing. Common Trees can be planted in tillable soil and tapped.
If a villager walks through the square where a crafted item was placed, the item will be destroyed. Below are player-created maps to indicate which tiles on the map are safe from villager-pathing. The tiles with the Rotten Plant should be safe.
Safe-pathing images of the interiors of homes and buildings can be found in the complete image gallery located at https://imgur.com/a/JlRXGlc
Note that items placed on the docks at the beach may be destroyed by villagers during the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies, or by Emily if married to her.  The image below is accurate for players who do not attend the festival and don't marry Emily.
Note for v1.5 only: Leo has additional pathing requirements
