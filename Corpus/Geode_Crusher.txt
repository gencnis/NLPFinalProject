 "Cave Patrol" Special Order


Ingredients:

 Gold Bar (2) Stone (50) Diamond (1)


The Geode Crusher is a piece of Refining Equipment that can be used to open geodes on the farm. The player receives the recipe after completing Clint's Special Order "Cave Patrol". It cannot open artifact troves or golden coconuts.
The Geode Crusher works like a furnace in that it consumes 1 geode and 1 coal to open a geode. It takes  60m (1h) to process.[1]
This item provides an alternative to paying 25g for Clint to open 1 geode.

Notes
Attempting to open a non-crushable item without any coal in the player's inventory results in a message saying that one coal is required, but attempting to do so with coal in the inventory does nothing at all.
Glitches
After cracking open a geode at Clint's, crushing a geode of the same type in a Geode Crusher will produce the same item.
