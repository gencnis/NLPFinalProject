Rice Shoots are a type of seed. Mature plants yield Unmilled Rice. Unmilled Rice is harvested using a Scythe.
Rice Shoots can be purchased  at Pierre's General Store starting in year 2 and occasionally from the Traveling Cart. They can also be obtained in Fishing Treasure Chests, Artifact Spots (in Spring),  by using the Seed Maker, or as a drop from Grubs (10% chance) in the Mines or Mutant Grubs in the Skull Cavern (Prehistoric Floors) or Mutant Bug Lair. In Winter they can also drop from Haunted Skulls (21.43% chance); in Spring from Wilderness Golems (6.25% chance).
Rice Shoots planted in most farm tiles take 8 days to mature with watering each day, as with other crops. However, Rice Shoots planted within 3 tiles of a Farm Pond or natural water source (excluding Wells and Fish Ponds) in any direction are considered to be irrigated, as in a rice paddy. Paddies need not be continuous with each other or adjacent to a pond in order to count as irrigated. Irrigated Rice Shoots take only 6 days to mature and do not require watering.

↑ The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.1, then another Unmilled Rice will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.1, at which point the chance for an extra Unmilled Rice ends. This, on average, will give 0.11 extra Unmilled Rice. Keep in mind that Luck can also double the amount of extra Unmilled Rice spawned by the above formula.
