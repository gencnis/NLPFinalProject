“

“My parents were bewildered when I told them I wanted to be a carpenter. They were pretty old-fashioned.”


— Robin


Robin is a villager who resides at 24 Mountain Road, on The Mountain, with her husband Demetrius, daughter Maru, and son Sebastian.
Robin is the town carpenter and runs her own Carpenter's Shop, at her home, from 9am to 5pm every day except Tuesday and part of Friday (closes early).

Schedule
Robin's shop is closed on Tuesday while she has a weekly exercise class at Caroline's home. However, if you stand in her path on her way out (near the cash register at 9:40am), you can use her shop momentarily. The shop can also be used as she returns at 7:50pm.
Robin won't leave her home on days when it's raining unless she has been hired to construct a farm building. Her shop will be closed for the days that she is on the Farm completing the construction.
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Robin may randomly spend Tuesday there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Robin will immediately go home to bed. Robin never visits the Resort on Festival days.
Shown below are Robin's schedules prioritized highest to lowest. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

Quotes


Regular 



First Meeting




“

“Have you met everyone in town yet? That sounds exhausting.”


Regular




“

“Have I told you that I built our house from the ground up? It's definitely been the highlight of my career so far.”





“

“Hey, if you need any materials or blueprints, my shop is the place you're looking for! Plus, your business supports the local economy.”





“

“Hey there, [Player]. I was just daydreaming about some new carpentry projects. Are you doing OK at your place? How's the woodwork in your cottage holding up?”





“

“You're always welcome to visit us, even if you aren't shopping, you know. It can get pretty lonely up here in the mountains.”





“

“You've met my son Sebastian, right? He lives downstairs. He's a little shy, but I'm sure he'll warm up to you if you're nice to him.”





“

“I found an ashtray in Sebastian's room, and it smelled really weird. Should I be worried about this?”





“

“Sometimes I worry about Sebastian... he doesn't have many friends and doesn't really seem to care about his future very much... I would talk to him about it but he never opens up to me.”





“

“Our house is in such a beautiful area, don't you think? I love the fresh air of the mountains.”





“

“I hope Demetrius doesn't blow the house up with those science experiments of his. I'm not even sure what he's working on. I think it has something to do with plants.”





“

“My husband almost set the house on fire last night with his science experiment. One of his beakers exploded and sent a fireball into the rafters! Thank Yoba I used fire-resistant lacquer when I built the place.”





“

“Sorry if it smells weird in here, [Player]. It's my husband's bizarre science project...”


After passing out in the Mines




“

“...I found you unconscious in the mines. I almost mistook you for a piece of exotic wood! Be a little more careful next time, okay?”


Rainy Days




“

“The rain doesn't stop me from getting a job done! Although soggy wood isn't a joy to work with.”


If Player is married to Sebastian




“

“I miss my Sebby... he was always a little misunderstood, but I believed in him.”





“

“Sebastian told me he's trying to quit smoking! I'm really proud of him.”





“

“I think the farm life is really healthy for Sebby.”


6+ Hearts




“

“Hi [Player]! It's good to see you. You're a regular member of the community now, don't you think?”


Community Center visited




“

“Hey! I heard that Lewis showed you around the Community Center... It'd be great if you could fix that place up. It used to be a really nice building!”


Quarry bridge restored




“

“Hey! I heard some weird noises last night, and woke up this morning to find the quarry bridge completely repaired! It's a miracle of woodworking!”


Community Center completed




“

“I knew it from the moment you stepped off that bus, [Player]... you were destined to be a town hero!”


Pam's house upgraded




“

“Our little plan worked out well, don't you think? Pam and Penny seem really happy.”


Summer




“

“Wood is a wonderful substance... it's versatile, cheap, strong, and each piece has it's own unique character!”





“

“If you need any buildings on your farm upgraded, just ask me! You'll need to provide enough lumber and stone for the project. And it costs money, too. But I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results!”





“

“We're pretty insulated from the rest of the world here in Stardew Valley. It has its pros and cons.”


Fall




“

“Maru likes gems. She uses them in her inventions. So how are you and Maru getting along?”





“

“You're always welcome to visit us, even if you aren't in the market for a building upgrade! It can get pretty lonely up here in the mountains.”





“

“Have you met the wild man that lives behind our house? I guess I don't really mind, as long as he doesn't bother us.”


Winter




“

“Hey, it's a perfect time of year to gather wood. Maybe you can collect enough to upgrade your house!”





“

“My parents were bewildered when I told them I wanted to be a carpenter. They were pretty old-fashioned.”





“

“Our house is in such a beautiful area, don't you think? Everything looks still after a fresh snow.”


At Ginger Island




“

“Wow, look at these structures! I can tell they were made by a master builder. I'm really impressed!”





“

“Hey, look! I can see another island from here.”





“
