The Shad is a fish that can be caught in the river (in Pelican Town or Cindersap Forest) and the Riverlands Farm, Forest Farm, or Hill-Top Farm during Spring, Summer, and Fall while raining. It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Wednesdays for 200g, or at the Traveling Cart for 180-1,000g.
Shad can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait.

Tailoring
Shad can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Fish Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as a green dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Shad can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The only possible output is green Shad Roe.
