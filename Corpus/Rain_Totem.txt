Caveats
The weather in Pelican Town and Ginger Island can be different, and the weather will only be changed in the region where the rain totem is activated.
A Rain Totem will not force the weather to be rainy on festival days or on the 1st day of a season.
If a Rain Totem is used during Winter on the day before a snowy day, it will cause it to rain and snow simultaneously the following day.
Using a Rain Totem will normally only cause regular rain. However, if used on a stormy day, the next day will also be stormy instead of rainy. Storms can be chained this way until the next Festival or the 1st of any season. This is an easy way to farm a lot of Battery Packs.
