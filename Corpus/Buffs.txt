Combining Buffs
In general, buffs do not stack, but instead replace any previous buffs. More specifically, buffs from exactly one food and one drink can be active at a given time. There are some special-effect buffs that are handled separately as described below.[1] Eating a food with buffs will wipe out any buffs from previously-eaten food (but not buffs from a previous drink); one drink's buffs will replace any previous drink's buffs, but have no effect on existing food buffs. Foods or drinks that have no buffs (but restore Health and Energy) can be safely consumed without any effect on active buffs.
Only three buffs, namely Luck, Speed, and Max Energy, are available from both food and drink and can therefore be stacked:

+1 Speed from Coffee or Triple Shot Espresso can be added to the +1 Speed from a food.
+30 Max Energy from Green Tea can be added to the +30 to +50 Max Energy from a food.
+1 Luck from Ginger Ale can be added to the +1, +2, +3, or +5 Luck from a food.
Special-effect and negative buffs ("debuffs") are each handled individually, independently of standard food- and drink-derived buffs: only one instance of each of these buffs can be active, and they are unaffected by other types of buffs.  The special-effect buffs are "Adrenaline Rush", "Oil of Garlic", "Squid Ink Ravioli Buff", "Warrior Energy", "Monster Musk", and "Yoba's Blessing"; the negative buffs are "Burnt", "Darkness", "Frozen", "Jinxed", "Nauseated", "Slimed", "Tipsy" and "Weakness".
For example, drinking an alcoholic beverage makes the player "Tipsy".  Drinking another alcoholic beverage replaces the first "Tipsy" effect with a new one (the magnitude remains -1 speed, but the duration is reset).  Consuming any other drink or food (including ones with buffs) will not remove the "Tipsy" effect -- at best, +1 Speed buff (e.g., from Coffee) can be used to counteract the -1 Speed.

Buff Duration
Buff durations are specified on the wiki and in-game using real-time minutes and seconds.
Buffs will pause while the game is paused, but they will not pause otherwise even if time is paused (e.g., playing the fishing minigame in singleplayer mode will still result in any buff durations continuing even though time is paused). 
Typically, 43 real-time seconds are equivalent to one game hour. (7 real-time minutes are 10 game hours.)
However, time in Skull Cavern runs more slowly: one game hour lasts 54 real-time seconds. (Except in multiplayer games and on Prehistoric Floors, which revert to 43-second hours).  So one cup of Coffee, that normally would last for two hours, will only last for one and a half hours in the Skull Cavern.
All buffs are cleared once the player sleeps.

Preventing negative buffs
Immunity and Squid Ink Ravioli mitigate or prevent the application of negative buffs to the player. The Slime Charmer Ring prevents the Slimed effect in particular from being applied. The Sturdy Ring cuts the duration of negative effects that are applied to the player in half.

Bugs
The Squid Ink Ravioli buff doesn't prevent the Tipsy debuff.
The Squid Ink Ravioli buff doesn't remain active if another food with a buff is consumed later. However, the special buff icon is still shown.
The Burnt debuff has a -3 Attack debuff which isn't listed in the icon's hover text.

History
Sometime between v1.11 and v1.3, a bug was removed that caused the duration of buffs to decrease as the day progressed.
