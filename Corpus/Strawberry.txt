Planting on Day of Egg Festival
Planting a lot of strawberries can be difficult during the evening after the Egg Festival concludes. The best strategy involves land preparation before the festival. Tilling, fertilizing, and watering can all be completed separately, hours prior to planting.

Trivia
It is possible to get three harvests from strawberry plants during Spring of year 1. This requires using Speed-Gro and planting on Spring 13, and the easiest way to do this is to complete the spring crops bundle; this requires planting cauliflower on Spring 1 as well as visiting the Community Center after the Egg Festival before planting the strawberries. The other way to acquire Speed-Gro by Spring 13 is to craft it, but this requires achieving level 3 foraging by Spring 6 to acquire Pine Tar in time, which is more difficult.
History
1.4: Removed from Summer help wanted quests.  Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.5: Iridium quality is now possible when using Deluxe Fertilizer.
