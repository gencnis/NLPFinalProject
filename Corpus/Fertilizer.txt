Fertilizer is used to support crop and tree growth, assisting farming. There are three types of crop fertilizer, affecting respectively crop quality, speed growth and water retention. There is only one tree fertilizer type, affecting growth speed. A fertilizer is used by placing it on tilled soil or the desired tree. Some crop fertilizers must be placed before the planted seed sprouts, the other fertilizers can be used at any time during plant growth. Each crop fertilizer type has three tiers, and the tree fertilizer has only one tier. Crop fertilizers affect all crops, including crops grown from Wild Seeds.

Mechanics
All fertilizer can be crafted. Recipes for first tier fertilizers are learned once the required level of Farming or Foraging skill is reached. Second tier recipes are learned once the required level of Farming skill is reached. Third tier recipes are purchased on Ginger Island. First and second tier crop fertilizers can also be purchased at Pierre's General Store year-round, or at The Oasis on specific days of the week.
Only one type of fertilizer may be used per soil tile. Fertilizer remains in the soil all season. When the season changes, fertilizer normally disappears. However, there are two exceptions in which fertilizer will remain in the soil:

If a multi-season crop (i.e., Ancient Fruit, Coffee Bean, Corn, Sunflower, or Wheat) is planted in the fertilized tile, and the new season is one in which the crop grows, the fertilizer will remain.
Fertilizer placed in the Greenhouse will remain in the soil unless it is un-tilled by a pickaxe.
Note that crop quality is determined at harvest time and not at planting time. Prior to 1.5, fertilizer used in the Greenhouse on crops which would mature out of their normal growing season might disappear before harvest and have no effect.
Speed gro affects only the growth and first harvest of a multi-harvest crop. Quality fertilizers (Basic Fertilizer, Quality Fertilizer, and Deluxe Fertilizer) affect all harvests of a multi-harvest crop.
Removing a crop with a Tool like the axe does not remove the fertilizer.  A second hit with a tool, such as a Pickaxe is required to remove the fertilizer and make the tile fallow.

Crop Quality Ratios
Note that quality is determined at the time of harvest, and not at the time of planting.  For crops that produce multiples at harvest (i.e., Coffee Bean, Blueberry, Cranberries), Basic, Quality, and Deluxe fertilizers affect only the first crop produced.
For the complete formula, please see Farming.

Once used on tilled soil, each type of fertilizer has a unique appearance, allowing you to see what type of fertilizer has been used on a given tile.

With the exception of Quality Fertilizer, crafting Fertilizer is always cheaper than purchasing it.  
Each time you craft Speed-Gro or Deluxe Speed-Gro, you receive 5 fertilizers.  Each time you craft Quality Retaining Soil, you receive 2 fertilizers, though crafting just one would still be cheaper than purchasing it.
The tables below compare the cost of crafting Speed-Gro or Deluxe Speed-Gro against purchasing them at the Oasis or Pierre's.  The cost of crafting is the sell price of the constituent ingredients.

Fertilizer used in a Garden Pot will disappear when harvesting the crop, especially if using seeds other than Wild Seeds.
History

1.5: Added tier three fertilizers. Fertilizer placed in the Greenhouse now lasts until manually removed.
