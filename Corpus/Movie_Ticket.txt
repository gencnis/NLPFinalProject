Sell Price:

500g


The Movie Ticket is an item that permits the player to enter the Movie Theater. It can also be given to other NPCs, which will invite them to attend the Movie Theater with the player.
It can be purchased for 1,000g from the ticket booth outside the Movie Theater. Once the Movie Theater has been built, there is also a chance to find one in the JojaMart Garbage Can. 
It can also be won in the Crane Game inside the Movie Theater, during any season (the Movie Ticket tends to be hidden in the foliage of the Crane Game until dislodged when the crane drops another prize).
