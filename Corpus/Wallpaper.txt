“Decorates the walls of one room”


For furniture, see Furniture.
For flooring, see Flooring.
Wallpaper is an item that is sold at both Pierre's General Store for 100g and JojaMart for 250g. A new wallpaper is sold each day. A wallpaper that is sold at JojaMart will be sold at Pierre's General Store on the following day.
Wallpaper can also be obtained from the Catalogue, a piece of furniture that can be purchased from Pierre's General Store for 30,000g. The Catalogue provides all wallpaper (and flooring) for 0g wherever the object is placed. The Catalogue always holds every wallpaper and flooring and does not rotate stock.
Wallpapers are one time use and do not stack. They cover the whole room they're placed in and can also be placed on hallway walls between rooms.
They do not have unique names, so the table below lists wallpaper in the same order shown in the catalog.
