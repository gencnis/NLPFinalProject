 "Juicy Bugs Wanted!" Special Order


Ingredients:

 Copper Bar (1) Sap (20) Solar Essence (5)


The Quality Bobber is a tackle that increases the quality of fish caught by one level (e.g., silver → gold). It can be crafted from a recipe received from Willy in the cutscene that follows the completion of the "Juicy Bugs Wanted!" Special Order. 
One Quality Bobber is received after solving the puzzle in Journal Scrap #4 on Ginger Island.
Aside from getting perfect catches, using this tackle is the only way to catch iridium quality fish. It is one of two fishing tackle that cannot be bought from Willy's Fish Shop, along with the Curiosity Lure.
Only the Iridium Rod can equip tackle. To attach tackle to an Iridium Rod, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the Iridium Rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle.
Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.
