Notes

↑ The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.02, then another Strawberry will spawn.  This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.02, at which point the chance for an extra Strawberry ends.  Daily Luck can double the amount of extra Strawberries spawned by the above formula.


Unlike most other types of seed, Strawberry Seeds have no sell value. This means that it is not profitable to process the crops with a Seed Maker to gain additional value.
