The Chub is a fish that can be caught in the mountain lake and the Cindersap Forest River during all seasons.  Unlike most fish found in the Forest River, it cannot be caught in Pelican Town.  It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Wednesdays for 200g, or at the Traveling Cart for 150-1,000g.
