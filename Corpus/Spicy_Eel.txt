Spicy Eel is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. 
Note: This recipe is profitable - it will result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients.
Spicy Eel can be purchased from the Desert Trader in exchange for 1 Ruby. It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock. Spicy Eel can be dropped by a Serpent in the Skull Cavern (6% chance). A Lava Eel Fish Pond may also produce five Spicy Eel when the population of the pond is at least 9 (3-4% chance).
