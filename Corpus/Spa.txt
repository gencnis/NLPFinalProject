Spa








Open Hours:

All Day


Closed:

Never


The Spa is located in the southwest area of the Railroad. 
By entering the Spa, passing through the changing room, and remaining stationary in the pool, energy and health are restored at 10 points per second[1].
There are two changing rooms - one for women and one for men. It is possible to enter the changing room opposite to the player's gender, but only after attempting to enter several times in quick succession from the pool area.
While passing through the covered path from the locker room to the pool, the player changes into a swimsuit whose color is the same as the player's chosen pants color. Prismatic pants result in a prismatic swimsuit. Undershorts result in a white swimsuit.

Trivia
It is possible to access the spa before unlocking the railroad by using the sword-swing glitch to get outside the map and walk around to the trigger area behind the blocked path.  Unfortunately, this will cause the character to be stuck in the area as trying to leave via the normal exit will cause them to get stuck in the rocks blocking the path.
