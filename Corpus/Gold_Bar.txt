Equipment:

 Furnace


Time to Craft:

 5h


Ingredients:

 Gold Ore (5) Coal (1)


A Gold Bar is created by smelting 5 Gold Ore in a furnace with 1 coal for fuel, or by transmuting 2 Iron Bars into one Gold Bar. Smelting Gold Ore in a furnace takes 5 in-game hours.  The "Transmute (Au)" recipe is earned at Mining Level 7. 
A Gold Bar can be found (rarely) in the Garbage Can next to the Blacksmith, after the player has unlocked the Furnace blueprint. Five Gold Bars are the reward for completing the  Enchanter's Bundle on the Bulletin Board.  If Clint is your secret gift-giver at the Feast of the Winter Star, he may give you 5 Gold Bars.
Gold Bars are also dropped from Dust Sprites (0.1% chance), Squid Kids (5% chance), Shadow Brutes (1% chance), and Shadow Shaman (1% chance).  They may be dug up in The Mines at floors 41-80 (0.1% chance).
Gold bars are used in a variety of crafting recipes and are used to upgrade tools to tier 4. One Gold Bar can be sold for 250g, or 375g with the Blacksmith Profession.
