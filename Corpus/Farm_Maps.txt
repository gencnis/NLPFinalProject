 The selection area for maps at character creation.
There are seven different Farm Maps to choose from in Stardew Valley. Each map offers a unique layout of the Farm, offering different benefits and favoring specific skills. Only one map can be chosen when starting a new game, and cannot be changed once selected.
The Standard Farm offers the most space to plant crops and raise animals. The other six farms lack farming area, but offer special perks in comparison:

The Riverland Farm encourages Fishing.
The Forest Farm encourages Foraging.
The Hill-top Farm encourages Mining.
The Wilderness Farm encourages Combat (but does not give any Combat experience for it).
The Four Corners Farm offers perks from other maps and encourages Multiplayer.
The Beach Farm offers extra items and encourages Fishing and Foraging, but discourages Farming late game.
The interior of the farmhouse is decorated to match the theme of the chosen map. This includes furniture, wallpaper and flooring. The exterior of the house is the same regardless of map choice.
There is an abandoned building on all maps which can later be turned into the Greenhouse. Once repaired, it can be moved by visiting the Carpenter's Shop or Wizard's Tower.

Description

Associated Skill


Standard Farm




The majority of this map is farming land, ideal for crops and animals.
The number of tillable tiles on this map is 3427, with 235 non-tillable but build-able tiles.
The biggest contiguous rectangular area is 63 x 31 (1953) tiles.

 Farming


Riverland Farm




The majority of this map is water. Fishing is viable on this farm:[1]
70% of the time, players will catch town river fish, i.e., fish that are found in Pelican Town.
30% of the time, players will catch forest fish, i.e., fish that are found in Cindersap Forest.
Water significantly decreases the amount of farming area.
The number of tillable tiles on this map is 1578, with 516 non-tillable but build-able tiles.

 Fishing


Forest Farm




The farm border is made of trees and foliage, just like in the Secret Woods.
Many bushes can be found on this map, including berry bushes.
The western clearings spawn 8 renewable Large Stumps (Hardwood), seasonal forage items, and unique Weeds that always drop Mixed Seeds. The possible forage items are:[2]
Spring: Dandelion, Leek, Morel, and Wild Horseradish (25% chance each)
Summer: Common Mushroom, Grape, Spice Berry, and Sweet Pea (25% chance each)
Fall: Chanterelle, Common Mushroom, Purple Mushroom, and Red Mushroom (25% chance each)
When fishing:[1]
5% of the time (modified by daily Luck), players will catch Woodskip. The exact formula is 0.05 + Daily Luck. This means that if the daily luck is at or below -0.05, there is no chance of catching a Woodskip. With maximum luck (0.125, only possible with the Special Charm), each cast has a 17.5% chance to hook a Woodskip.
45% of the rest of the time, players will catch pond and river fish, i.e., fish that are found in Cindersap Forest.
Otherwise, players will catch only trash.
Additional ponds and grass areas decrease the overall farming area.
The number of tillable tiles on this map is 1413, with 1490 non-tillable but build-able tiles.

 Foraging


Hill-top Farm




The southwest hilltop spawns Stones, Ore nodes, and Geode nodes depending on the player's Mining level. If farm quarry is cleared, it will usually regenerate 7-13 items every 4th day, which appears to be the optimal day to clear the farm quarry.  The mining area may sometimes be blocked by a Large Stump, Large Log, or a Boulder, making it impossible to enter until the player has the correct tool.
Additional cliffs and a stream decrease the overall farming area.
When fishing:[1]
50% of the time, players will catch forest river fish, i.e., fish that are found in the Cindersap Forest river.
50% of the time, players will catch only trash.
The number of tillable tiles on this map is 1648, with 930 non-tillable but build-able tiles.

 Mining


Wilderness Farm




Monsters spawn at night (scales with the player's Combat level). This map can spawn more Wilderness Golems than other farms if they have spawning monster enabled. See Advanced options for more info.
When fishing:[1]
35% of the time, players will catch lake fish, i.e., fish that are found in The Mountain lake.
65% of the time, players will catch only trash.
Additional cliffs and ponds decrease the overall farming area.
The number of tillable tiles on this map is 2131, with 444 non-tillable but build-able tiles.

 Combat


Four Corners Farm




The farming area is split by cliffs into four distinct areas, each reminiscent of some of the other Farm Maps.
Top left: Forest Farm. This quadrant has a small grassy area containing a Large Stump, and weeds here can transform into the unique ones that always drop mixed seeds, the same as on the Forest Farm.
Top right: Standard Farm. This quadrant has the most farming space.
Bottom left: This quadrant has a pond. Players have a 50% chance of catching forest pond fish, i.e., fish that are found in the Cindersap Forest pond.[1]
Bottom right: Hilltop Farm. This quadrant contains a small quarry that spawns Rocks and Ore and Geode nodes depending on the player's Mining level.
Additional cliffs and ponds decrease the overall farming area.
The number of tillable tiles on this map is 2952.

 Multiplayer


Beach Farm




Good foraging and fishing, and a lot of open space. Sometimes, supply crates wash up on shore.
Both forest and beach foragables may spawn.
Sprinklers don't work in the sandy soil.
Intended for "seasoned players", not as a first farm.
The number of tillable tiles on this map is 2700, with 1928 non-tillable but build-able tiles.
There is a patch of 202 tiles (10x20 plus 2) where sprinklers can be placed.
When fishing:[1]
15% of the time, players will catch Seaweed.
5.1% of the time, players will catch one of Oyster, Coral, Mussel or Cockle. Chances for each item are equal.
52.73% of the time, players will catch ocean fish, i.e., fish that are found in The Beach.
27.17% of the time, players will catch trash.
