“

“Being wealthy and popular throughout high school has made Haley a little conceited and self-centered. She has a tendency to judge people for superficial reasons.  But is it too late for her to discover a deeper meaning to life? Is there a fun, open-minded young woman hidden within that candy-coated shell?”


— Dev Update #12


Haley is a villager who lives in Pelican Town. She's one of the twelve characters available to marry.

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Haley may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Haley will immediately go home to bed. Haley never visits the Resort on Festival days or her checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.
Shown below are Haley's schedules prioritized highest to lowest within each season. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

Heart Events
Two Hearts

Enter Haley and Emily's home when they're both there.



Details 


Haley and Emily are fighting about cleaning under the couch cushions when you arrive. Emily is upset that Haley refuses to clean the cushions. Haley says she cleaned them last week, and Emily thinks Haley is being childish. You're tasked with resolving the conflict.
"Stop whining and just clean it!" (-50 friendship.) Haley angrily storms off and Emily cleans the cushions.
"Haley, why not have this be your one weekly job?" (+30 friendship.) Both agree, though Haley isn't ecstatic about it.
"Emily, take the high road and do it this time." (-30 friendship.) Haley is upset that you implied she's being childish. Emily cleans the cushions.

Four Hearts

Enter Haley's home when she's there.



Details 


Haley is struggling to open a jar, and asks if the player is strong.
"Yes." (+30 friendship.) Haley responds: "Great, then you shouldn't have any problem opening this jar for me!"
"No." (-30 friendship.) Haley responds: "Oh... you aren't? Hmmm... Well could you try opening this jar for me anyways?"
After opening the jar, Haley says you're stronger than you look. The next day, she'll usually have dialogue about having found a tool to help her open jars.


Six Hearts

Go to the beach between 10 AM and 4 PM during any season except Winter.



Details 


You find Haley grieving after losing her bracelet.
"Relax, I'll just buy you a new one!" (-30 friendship.) Haley responds: "No, you won't! This bracelet was passed down to me by my great-grandmother!"
"I'm really sorry..." (+50 friendship.) Haley responds: "*sigh* ...Maybe it'll wash up on another shore. I can't bear to think of it at the bottom of the ocean."
After choosing an answer, Haley reveals that the bracelet belonged to her great grandmother. The bracelet is located to the right of Elliott's cabin behind a shrub. After returning the bracelet, Haley hugs you and says she won't forget what you've done.


Eight Hearts

On a sunny day during any season except Winter, enter Cindersap Forest between 10 AM and 4 PM.



Details 


You meet Haley at Marnie's ranch as she's taking photos. She asks you to take some pictures with her, and asks how to approach a cow. She climbs on one, falls off and gets covered in dirt. Haley giggles and leaves to take a shower.
The next morning, Haley will write you a letter that says:




“

“[Player],
I thought it would be fun to write you a note.
I had so much fun with the cows yesterday... I'm
starting to understand why you chose the farmer's
life! Hope to see you soon.
-Haley”




Ten Hearts

Enter Haley's house when she's there.



Details 


Haley shows you her dark room for developing photos.
"It looks great!" (+10 friendship.)
"What does it do?" (No effect on friendship.)
"I've seen better." (-50 friendship.)
Haley asks what you want to do now.

Offer to help decorate the dark room. (No effect on friendship.) Ends the scene and disappoints Haley.
Make an excuse and leave. (No effect on friendship.)
Try to kiss her. (No effect on friendship.) Haley responds, "Oh, <your name>... I've been waiting so long for you to do that. One moment..." She flips a switch, the room goes mostly black except where you and Haley are standing, and you both lean in close for a kiss as the cutscene ends. If you talk to her immediately after the cutscene, she says "That was nice" with her red/blushing portrait.

Group Ten-Heart Event

Since her ten-heart event also triggers at her home, the two events will happen together.
If the player is unmarried and has given a bouquet to all available bachelorettes, raised friendship with each bachelorette to 10 hearts, and seen each bachelorette's 10-heart event, then entering Haley/Emily's House will trigger a cutscene. If Haley is the final bachelorette you share a Ten-Heart Event with, the Group Ten-Heart Event will be unavoidable as it is triggered immediately afterwards.



Details 


If the player has a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, the cutscene will consist of a gossip session about Mayor Lewis and Marnie's relationship.
If the player does not have a Rabbit's Foot in inventory, all bachelorettes will express anger about the player dating them all at one time.  Regardless of the player's dialogue choice(s), all bachelorettes will decide to give the player the "cold shoulder" for about a week after the event.  They will give angry dialogue when interacted with, and refuse gifts.  After about a week, all bachelorettes will forgive the player, and dialogues return to normal.


This event will trigger only one time per save file. This event will not trigger if you are married or have given a Wilted Bouquet or Mermaid's Pendant to one of the marriage candidates. 

Fourteen Hearts

Part 1: Enter town between 8am and 3pm on a day that's not raining.Part 2: At least one day later, enter the Farm House between 6:20am and 5pm.Part 3: Enter Pelican Town with a chocolate cake in inventory between 6am and 3pm on a day that's not raining.



Details 


Part 1:On her way to her house, Haley overhears a conversation between Vincent, Jas, and Penny. Jas complains about her math book cover falling off, and Penny notices that all her books are falling apart. Penny says "new books are expensive, so we'll just have to make do with what we have..." Vincent asks "Does this mean I don't have to do my homework?" Talking to Haley after the scene will result in her saying: "I've been thinking about cake a lot lately...".
Part 2:
Haley says she wants to get everyone together for a charity cake-walk in town on the next sunny day, and explains that it's kind of like musical chairs but everyone gets cake. She asks the player to bring a Chocolate Cake.

Yes (No effect on friendship.)
Haley replies "Great! I'll meet you in the town square tomorrow, weather permitting."

Yes (begrudgingly) (No effect on friendship.)
Haley replies "What's up with the snarky attitude? Fine. You're going to show up tomorrow with a chocolate cake, or else you're in the dog house. You like that better?"
Haley says she's bringing Pink Cake, and the "Haley's Cake-Walk" quest is added to the Journal.
Part 3:
Most of the villagers are gathered in the town square, with Jas, Vincent, Pam, Emily, Caroline, Marnie, Jodi, and Clint participating in the cakewalk. After the player delivers the chocolate cake to Haley, she stops the cakewalk and begins to distribute the prizes, with Pam receiving the player's cake.
After all the prizes have been given, Haley reveals that she overheard Penny's conversation, and held the cakewalk to raise money for new books. Penny is grateful to both Haley and the player for their kindness. Jas is excited and Vincent is crestfallen at the prospect of new books.  Robin then tries to convince Lewis to lower their business tax since education is being funded without tax money, and Pierre joins her against a shocked Lewis.


Marriage
Main article: Marriage
Once married, Haley will move into the farmhouse. Like other marriage candidates, she will add her own room to the right of the bedroom. She'll also set up a small garden behind the farmhouse where she'll sometimes go to take pictures.
On rainy mornings, Haley may offer you something sweet for breakfast:  Cookie, Blueberry Tart, Pancakes, Poppyseed Muffin, or Maple Bar.  On mornings when Haley stays inside the farmhouse all day, she may offer you Fried Egg, Omelet, Hashbrowns, Pancakes, or Bread for breakfast.  On rainy nights she may offer you dinner:  Chowder, Eggplant Parmesan, Bean Hotpot, or Parsnip Soup.

Regular 



First meeting




“

“Oh... you're that new farmer [boy/girl], aren't you? Huh? Oh... I'm Haley. Hmm... If it weren't for those horrendous clothes you might actually be [cute/pretty]. Actually, nevermind.”


Regular




“

“This town is so small. It sucks. I have to drive, like, twenty miles to buy any decent clothes. That's why I usually just order online. What?”





“

“The only thing I like about this town is the beach.”





“

“*sigh* I could really go for a cupcake right now. Do you need something?”





“

“I’ve decided I am going to organise my clothes today. I'll have to throw out all of last year's styles to make room for the new ones!”





“

“Don't you get tired of running around on that farm all day, or whatever it is you do? I couldn't stand getting all dirty like that. You probably get a nice tan, though.”





“

“I'm feeling an urge to go shopping. Ugh! I wish there was a mall here.”





“

“My sister is so weird. Sometimes I wonder if we're actually related.”





“

“Did you know that my sister hates [item]? She finds it absolutely revolting. I guess everyone has their hang-ups.”


If Female




“

“Nice makeup. Wait... Are you even wearing any? I'm bored.”


If Male




“

“Nice shoes. Are those made out of plastic? I'm bored.”


If sold crops to Pierre

Rainy Day




“

“I spent all morning doing my hair... now the rain could mess it up. *sigh* ... Life is hard sometimes.”


6+ hearts:




“

“I need a new hobby other than shopping. I've decided to expand my horizons. Maybe I should learn to play the mini-harp?”





“

“I used to complain about this town being so small, but I've grown to like it. If it was much bigger it wouldn't feel like a community.”





“

“I cooked dinner last night. It actually turned out okay! But I did make a huge mess in the kitchen...”





“

“I'm thinking about donating a bunch of clothes... I must have a hundred pairs of shoes.”


8+ hearts:




“

“There are only two things I like about this town. One of them is the beach. The other one is a secret! *giggle*”





“

“Yesterday I found a seagull with her wing caught in a net. I set her free, of course. She looked so helpless, the poor thing.”





“

“You know, I should probably start exercising more... this youthful metabolism won't last forever.”


Spring




“

“I wonder if any nice shells washed up on the beach this morning? This isn't the best time of year for shells, though.”

“

“Ew, you're all dirty.”

“Do you wear those clothes every day?”





“

“There's not a cloud in the sky today.”





“

“It's so hot today! I wish I had some ice cream.”





“

“I spent 3 hours practicing my signature today. I guess that's pretty silly, huh?”


6+ hearts:




“

“If you stay in the sun a lot it will make your hair lighter... But you don't want to get sunburnt, either. I just want a healthy amount of sunlight. Everything in moderation, right?”





“

“I should start reading some books instead of magazines. It's good to learn things, isn't it? I only ever look at the pictures.”





“

“I talked to my sister for a while last night. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. You know, Emily's not actually that weird. I guess we have more in common than I used to think. Don't tell her I said so.”





“

“It's a nice day to go swimming.”


8+ hearts:




“

“I guess living in the country isn't so bad. If I lived in the city I might start to miss all the trees. [Player], I think I've been hanging out with you too much.”

“Hey I found this new tool to open jars with. So you won't need to help me anymore.”

“

“Oh, hi. Did you want something?”





“

“I feel the urge to go shopping. *sigh*”





“

“Is that a grass stain on your knee? Sorry, I'm allergic to grass.”





“

“I've never been to the forest. It's muddy and I could get a blister on my foot.”





“

“Something smells earthy... Oh, right. You work on a farm.”





“

“You look like you've been doing a lot of hard work. Why don't you take the rest of the day off?”





“

“If you're ever bored, come say hi.”


6+ hearts:




“

“Shopping just doesn't sound as fun as it used to. What's happening to me? Hmm...”





“

“See this bracelet? It belonged to my great-grandmother. She was a really interesting lady.”





“

“I've never been to the forest, you know. It might be interesting to explore it some day.”


If player has seen Haley's 6 Heart Event




“

“Did I ever tell you I found another one of my great-grandma's bracelets in the attic? She was a really interesting lady.”


8+ hearts:




“

“I'm starting to like the smell of dirt. Isn't that weird? I think it's because you're around all the time.”


Winter




“

“I want to move somewhere warmer.”





“

“It's too cold to get out of bed.”





“

“Hi. Do you need something from me?”





“

“Hmm. What brand is your shirt? Oh. Um, nevermind.”





“

“I wish someone would bring me a peppermint coffee. Don't even bother, I know you won't be able to make one.”





“

“I'm going to start writing a list of all the clothes I need for next spring.”





“

“Do you have a pony on your farm? Oh. That's disappointing...”





“

“The only good thing about winter is that I get to sleep more. I like at least 10 hours of sleep every night.”





“

“Will you say hi to Alex for me? Thanks.”





“

“Your name is [Player], right? I keep forgetting.”





“

“Hi [Player]. Is anything exciting happening on your farm?”


6+ hearts:




“

“I think I'm starting to realize that clothes aren't the most important thing. Right?
I still like clothes, though. I mean, what's wrong with expressing yourself a little?”






“

“Maybe I'll donate some of my skirts to a charity this spring.
I mean, I do have over 1,000 skirts.
...what?”






“

“Um, if you see Alex could you tell him I'm busy today? Thanks.”


8+ hearts:




“

“I wish it were warmer here in Stardew Valley. I could move somewhere else, but...”





“

“Do you think you'll ever have a pony on your farm?”





“

“I'm glad you have less work to do in the winter. It must be nice to have a break, huh”


Raining




“

“The weather's too horrible to get out of bed.”


Doctor Visit




“

“It's nothing serious... I'm just here for my annual check-up.”





“

“Well... my nose has been a little runny, Doctor. But otherwise I'm doing fine!”


At Ginger Island




“

“I saw a dolphin on the way in!”





“

“This is such a perfect beach. I'd stay here forever if I could!”





“

“It's strange the places life can take you... who knows what other lands are out there?”





“

“Wow, look at how the sunlight sparkles on the horizon! I bet the sunsets here would make for an amazing photo. I have to remember to bring my camera next time.”





“

“Getting the perfect tan is an artform... It's kind of like toasting a marshmallow... you have to rotate the body just right.”





“

“Laying out on a tropical beach. *sigh* I think I've finally found my place in the universe. But I guess Stardew Valley's not such a bad place either!”





“

“Emily's friend had this swimsuit shipped to me from all the way out in Zuzu City. City fashion is on a whole different level, isn't it?”





“

“I painted my toenails blue to match the sea. What do you think? *wiggle* *wiggle*”





“

“Gus made a cute, fruity drink just for me!”





“

“There's something about the sun that just makes me feel good.”


Dating / 10 Hearts:




“

“[Player], can we go on a camping trip someday? The most exotic place I've been is Zuzu city.”

“

“[Player], I'm happy to see you today.”





“

“[Player], you look [rugged/pretty] today. I like it.”


When engaged




“

“I'm so happy! It's just like I always dreamed.”

After Group 10 Heart Event




“

“I've got nothing to say to you!”





“

Portraits













































































Timeline
Haley's look evolved over the years the game was in development.
Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Haley's style changed over the years before the game was launched.


Trivia
Haley's personality drastically changes the more hearts you have with her. She starts off saying that she "hates this small town" and talks endlessly about malls and shopping. At seven to ten hearts, she talks about donating her clothes to charity and saying she's glad the town is small, because if it was any bigger it wouldn't be a community.
Even though Haley's ten heart scene is all about her dark room, a new dark room is not included in her added room after marriage.
 Screenshot from Dev Update 13 referencing peppermint coffee
In the "pink cake" episode of "The Queen of Sauce" (the 21st of Summer, Year 2), The Queen says, "A viewer from Pelican Town wrote to me recently... let's see... Her name's Haley. She wrote, 'I tried your pink cake last time I was in Zuzu City and I fell in love with it. Could you share the recipe on your next episode?'. Well, why not? It's a marvelous cake. And you'll never guess the secret ingredient... melon!"
On Wednesdays in Winter, Haley may say "I wish someone would bring me a peppermint coffee. Don't even bother, I know you won't be able to make one."  This may lead players to believe that Peppermint Coffee is available, and is one of Haley's loved or liked gifts.  In fact, Peppermint Coffee cannot be crafted, cooked, or brewed, and is not available in-game anywhere.  In early game development, Haley would say "The only thing I like about winter is peppermint coffee... hey, are you even listening?"
Clicking on Haley's portrait from her page on the Social Menu will result in her posing as if a picture was being taken.
In the 8-heart event, if the player is wearing a Prismatic clothing item, it can be seen animated on the pictures, even though pictures are normally static.
