The Magnet is a type of bait that increases the chance of finding treasure chests by 15% (30% chance base instead of 15% base). It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for 1,000g after reaching fishing level 9. It can also be purchased from the Casino for 1,000. It is received as one of the prizes for winning the Ice Fishing Contest at the Festival of Ice for the first time, and can also be received as a gift from Willy at the Feast of the Winter Star. It may also randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Wednesdays for 200g, or at the Traveling Cart for 100-1,000g.
Magnets cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod and the Iridium Rod can use bait. Magnets can also technically be used in a Crab Pot, but it is no better than standard bait as crab pots never yield any treasure.

Notes
Despite the description, the Magnet has the same effect on fish bite rate as standard Bait (decreasing biting time by 50%).
While the Magnet can be purchased at the Fish Shop for 1,000g, crafting is a cheaper option, even if purchasing the ingredients.  In year 1, 5 Iron Ore and 1 Coal cost 900g at the Blacksmith (300g per magnet).  In years 2+, 5 Iron Ore and 1 Coal cost 1,500g (500g per magnet).
Success at playing the minigames in the Casino can also yield virtually free Magnets from the Casino shop.
