The Pufferfish is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at The Beach or on the Beach Farm on sunny summer days between 12pm and 4pm, or on Ginger Island during any season on Island West (ocean), South, Southeast, and in the Pirate Cove.  It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer, or at the Traveling Cart for 600-1,000g.
Pufferfish can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait.
The Pufferfish and the Blobfish are the only fishing rod fishes that have a "floater" behavior in the fishing mini-game.

Pufferfish can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days.  The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests.  The only possible output is yellow Pufferfish Roe.
