Ingredients:

 Any Fish (1)

Sashimi is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.
Sashimi may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock.
Note: This recipe can be profitable if using fish worth less than 75g (see When to turn fish into sashimi for more info).  Saving fish worth less than 75g for Help Wanted quests may be a better option, though, since these quests generally pay triple the fish's base value.  (Periwinkle is an exception -- at 20g base price it's more profitable to turn into Sashimi than save for quests).
