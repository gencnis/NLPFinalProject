Battery Pack





It's fully charged with precious energy.


Information 


Source:

Lightning Rod • Solar Panel •  Iridium Bat (5%)


Sell Price:

500g


 Uncharged vs Charged rod
 Lightning striking a Rod
The Battery Pack is created in the Lightning Rod during thunderstorms or the Solar Panel after 7 sunny days. 
To acquire a Battery Pack from a Lightning Rod, during a thunderstorm a particular sound will be heard, which means that one of the rods is now charged, pulsating with energy. There is no guarantee that a specific lightning rod will be struck by lightning during a thunderstorm. On the day after the storm, a Battery Pack can be acquired from it.
Battery Packs can sometimes be purchased from the Traveling Cart for 1,500-2,500g and can be sold to Robin at the Carpenter's Shop.  Very rarely, a Battery Pack can be dropped by breaking boxes or crates in the Skull Cavern.  They may also be dropped by Iridium Bats (5% chance).
Kent and Pam may also send the player a Battery Pack in the mail.
Three Battery Packs will be received as a reward for completing the Children's Bundle in the Community Center.
