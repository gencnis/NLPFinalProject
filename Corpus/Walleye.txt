The Walleye is a fish that can be caught in the river (in Pelican Town or Cindersap Forest), the mountain Lake, and the Cindersap Forest pond during Fall when it is raining. It can also be caught in Winter if a Rain Totem is used. It can randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Fall and Winter, or at the Traveling Cart for 315-1,000g. If the player chooses the Riverland Farm or the Forest Farm, Walleye can also be caught in the farm pond.
Walleye can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait.
Walleye is most common in the Cindersap Forest pond. Every cast in the pond during raining Fall days has a 32% chance of hooking a Walleye.
