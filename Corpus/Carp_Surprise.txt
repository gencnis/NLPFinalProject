Ingredients:

 Carp (4)

Carp Surprise is a cooked dish. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit.
Note: this recipe is profitable - it will result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients.  Turning the Carp into Sashimi will be even more profitable, however.
Carp Surprise may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays or in the Stardrop Saloon's rotating stock.
