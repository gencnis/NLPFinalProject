The Deluxe Scarecrow is a craftable scarecrow that prevents crows from eating a player's crops. The player can obtain the recipe for a Deluxe Scarecrow only after obtaining all 8 rarecrows, which will trigger the "Z.C. Rarecrow Society" to send the player a letter containing the recipe with a 90.5% probability each night until it is delivered.[1]
The Deluxe Scarecrow has double the radius (16) of that of a normal scarecrow (8), affecting a total of 888 tiles.
