The Midnight Squid is a fish that can be caught in the submarine ride at the Night Market, which takes place at The Beach during Winter 15-17. It can also be caught by using Magic Bait in the southwest corner of the beach: From the left-most pier, in the southwestern corner, fish facing west.
In the submarine ride at the Night Market, there is a 21% chance to hook a Midnight Squid (17% if using a Curiosity Lure).[1] If using Magic Bait in the southwest corner of the beach, there is a 3.3% chance to hook a Midnight Squid (6.8% if using a Curiosity Lure).[2]
When placed in a Fish Pond this fish will produce Squid Ink instead of Roe.
