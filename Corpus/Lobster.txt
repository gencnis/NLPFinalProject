Tailoring
Lobster can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Sailor Shirt.   It can also be used as a red dye color at the dye pots in Emily's and Haley's house, located at 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Lobsters can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 3 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. Typical output includes red Lobster Roe, Seaweed, and various Trash items, but more valuable items are possible starting at population 5.
