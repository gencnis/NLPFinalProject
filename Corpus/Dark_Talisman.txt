The Dark Talisman can be found in a chest in the Mutant Bug Lair.  Obtaining it is part of the Dark Talisman quest.  It is used to open the passage at the northeast end of the Railroad.
Once obtained, it can be found in the wallet in the The Player's Menu on the Skills tab.  Oddly enough, it remains in the wallet even after using it.
