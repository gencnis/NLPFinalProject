Not all processing of animal products results in a price gain.  This page lists the profitability of processing animal products at different quality levels and Farming Professions.
Note that regular chicken eggs always produce normal quality Mayonnaise and Large Eggs produce gold quality mayonnaise.  Duck Mayonnaise, Void Mayonnaise, and Dinosaur Mayonnaise are always normal quality.  The quality of these eggs is not a factor. However, Ostrich Eggs produce 10 jars of Mayonnaise, where the quality of the Mayonnaise will be equal to the quality of the Ostrich Egg used.
Similarly, normal sized Milk always produces normal quality Cheese and Large Milk always produces gold quality Cheese.  Normal sized Goat Milk always produces normal quality Goat Cheese and Large Goat Milk always produces gold quality Goat Cheese.  The quality of the milk is not a factor.
When using quality Wool with a Loom, there is a chance of receiving two Cloth:

 Silver quality wool = 10% chance
 Gold quality wool = 25% chance
 Iridium quality wool = 50% chance
Mayonnaise produced using Ostrich Eggs and Cloth are the only artisan goods in the game that are actually affected by the quality level of the input.

When to process animal products
Below is a quick reference table indicating when to process animal products, without regard to aging in casks. Aging cheese or goat cheese in a cask will almost always result in profit. This table also does not take into account the chance of obtaining 2 Cloth from 1 Wool.  Obtaining 2 cloth from 1 higher quality wool is never guaranteed, and can result in a net loss on an individual wool if only 1 cloth is produced. However, in the long run the chance for extra cloth makes processing wool profitable on average for all quality levels (with iridium wool producing 1.5 cloth on average, gold 1.25, and silver 1.1).
