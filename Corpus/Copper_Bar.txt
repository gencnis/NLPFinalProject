Bundles
A Copper Bar is used in the  Blacksmith's Bundle in the Boiler Room.

Tailoring
A Copper Bar is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Copper Breastplate.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
The Copper Bar may be randomly requested during any season at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 180g and 150 Friendship points.  A Copper Bar will never be requested until you have the Furnace blueprints.
4 Copper Bars may be requested by Stonefish in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 7 to 10.
3 Copper Bars may be requested by Catfish in a Fish Pond quest to increases the capacity of the pond from 3 to 5.
Notes
It is more profitable to sell Copper Bars than to transmute them into Iron Bars and sell the Iron Bars. However, it is even more profitable to craft them into Trap Bobbers to sell.
History
1.0: Introduced.
1.4: Can now be used in Tailoring. Can be requested in Fish Pond quests.  Now used to make the Charcoal Kiln.
