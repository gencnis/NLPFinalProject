“

“You can play with my dolls if you want to. Just make sure to brush their hair when you're done.”


— Jas


Jas is a villager who lives just outside Pelican Town.  She's a young girl, and can often be found with her best friend Vincent.

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Jas may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Jas will immediately go home to bed. Jas never visits the Resort on Festival days or her checkup day at Harvey's Clinic. Jas also never visits the Resort without an adult accompanying her.
