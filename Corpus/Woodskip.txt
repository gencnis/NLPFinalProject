The Woodskip is a fish that can be caught in the pond in the Secret Woods during any season. It is most prevalent there on non-rainy days, with each cast having a 15% to 27% chance to hook a Woodskip depending on fishing skill. The Woodskip is more likely to hook at higher Fishing Zones.[1] It can also be caught on the Forest Farm, with each cast having a 0% to 17.5% chance to hook a Woodskip depending on daily luck.[2] It can also randomly be found at the Traveling Cart for 225-1,000g.

Tailoring
The Woodskip can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Vest.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Woodskips can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 2 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. Typical output includes orange Woodskip Roe and wood, but other tree-related products are possible starting at population 6.

Quests
Two Woodskip may be requested by Dorado, Lingcod, or Pike in a Fish Pond quest to increase the capacity of the pond from 7 to 10.
References

↑ See "Spawn rate" on the Modding fish data page.

↑ See Farm::getFish in the game code. The exact chance is equal to 0.05 + Daily Luck meaning there is no chance of hooking a Woodskip if daily luck is at or below -0.05. Maximum chance occurs with a natural daily luck of 0.1 and having the Special Charm.


History
1.4: Added iridium quality.  Can now be used in Tailoring.  Can be requested in Fish Pond quests.
