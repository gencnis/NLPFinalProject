The Octopus is a fish that can be caught in the ocean at The Beach or on the Beach Farm during Summer or in the ocean on Ginger Island West during any season. It can also randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Summer, or at the Traveling Cart for 450-1,000g. There is a 2.2% chance to hook an Octopus during the deep-sea submarine ride at the Night Market during Winter 15-17 (1.6% if using a Curiosity Lure).
Octopus can be caught regardless of time of day or season using Magic Bait.
The Octopus and the Stonefish are the only fish caught with a fishing rod that cannot be eaten unless used in a recipe.
Other than Legendary Fish, this is the most difficult fish to catch in the game. Each cast has a 4-11% chance to hook an Octopus at the Beach and a 5-18% chance on Ginger Island West, with probabilities somewhat dependent on exact time and weather, and higher probabilities at higher fishing levels and zones.

Map
The Octopus can be found in the ocean at the Beach or the ocean on Ginger Island West.


Strategy
This is an extremely difficult fish to catch, even compared to Legendary Fish.  To make it more demanding, the chances of hooking an octopus and the window of time to catch it are very small. The most efficient way to try to catch this is to reach fishing level 10, equip the Iridium Rod, eat a food that provides a fishing Buff, and attach a Trap Bobber or Cork Bobber to the fishing pole.

Tailoring
Octopus is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Blue Buttoned Vest.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Octopus can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The primary output is orange Octopus Roe, but Omni Geodes are also possible starting at population 9.

History
1.3.27: Added chance to catch during Night Market.
1.4: Added iridium quality.  Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.4.4: Fixed a mistake in the game data that prevented octopus-specific fish pond data from being applied (in earlier versions, octopus used the same fish pond data as all generic ocean fish).
1.5: Is now used in a remixed bundle. Can now be caught in the ocean on Ginger Island West.
