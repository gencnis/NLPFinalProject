ConcernedApe is Eric Barone, the creator and lead developer of Stardew Valley, as well as the name of the company he founded to continue game development. From 2012 to 2019, he was the sole developer of the game (except the multiplayer networking code in 1.3) and created all art, sound effects, and music. He currently resides in Seattle, Washington.
In early 2019, ConcernedApe formed a small development team to continue updating the game. The 1.4 update of the game was developed by ConcernedApe, Arthur Lee (a.k.a. Mr. Podunkian), and Alex Erlandson (a.k.a. zillix). The 1.5 update of the game was developed by ConcernedApe and Arthur Lee. See Stardew Valley for more info about the game's development.
In late 2021 he announced ConcernedApe’s Haunted Chocolatier, a new game still in development. ConcernedApe began work on this game in late 2020 as the sole developer. 

Trivia
Setting the favorite thing when starting the game to "ConcernedApe" will trigger special dialogue upon consumption of a Stardrop.
When launching Stardew Valley, if the player clicks on ConcernedApe's face, he will open his eyes or remove his sunglasses and a 'splat' or honk sound will play.
