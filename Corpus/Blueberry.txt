The Blueberry is a fruit crop that grows from Blueberry Seeds after 13 days.  A Preserves Jar can make Blueberries into jelly, and a Keg can make them into wine, which can then be aged in a Cask. When sold, blueberry prices benefit from the Tiller profession, and its jelly and wine prices benefit from the Artisan profession.

Fertilizer
Basic Fertilizer and Quality Fertilizer only affect the first berry from every harvest, which means 2 out of 3 berries harvested from each bush are going to be regular quality crops. That makes Speed-Gro an optimal fertilizer for this crop, as it gives one extra harvest before the Fall (assuming planting on day 1 of the summer), increasing season earnings from Blueberry by 25% compared to at most 6% with Quality Fertilizer.[1]
Deluxe Speed-Gro yields the same number of harvests as regular Speed-Gro, usually at a higher cost.  (One exception is purchasing Deluxe Speed-Gro from the Oasis for 80g vs. purchasing Speed-Gro from Pierre's General Store for 100g.)

Trivia
On Sundays in Summer, Mayor Lewis may say "Say, are you growing any blueberries on your farm? I do enjoy a fresh blueberry."  Mayor Lewis does in fact like blueberries as gifts.

↑ For the first berry, the maximum relative increase in berry price when using quality fertilizer is at level 6, where the average berry price without any fertilizer is 56 (50*1.16, see table for normal soil) and the average price with quality fertilizer is 66 (50*131, see table for quality fertilizer). The average total price (adding in the always-normal-quality second and third berries) is therefore 156 without fertilizer or 166 with quality fertilizer. 166 is 6% larger than 156.
