The Dark Shrine of Memory is an altar found in the Witch's Hut. It can be accessed after completing the Goblin Problem quest. The player can offer 30,000g to erase all divorced spouses' memories, making it seem like they had never been married. This effect takes place immediately after using the shrine. 
Talking to the divorced spouses right after wiping their memories will result in this dialogue:




“

“You're the new farmer, aren't you? You seem... no. I'm sure we've never met.”
