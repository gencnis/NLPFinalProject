↑ The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.1, then another Cranberry will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.1, at which point the chance for an extra Cranberry ends. This, on average, will give 0.11 extra Cranberries. Keep in mind that Luck can also double the amount of extra Cranberries spawned by the above formula.
