The Slimejack is a fish that can be caught in the Mutant Bug Lair during all seasons.
It's challenging to fish for the Slimejack, as the Mutant Flies inside the Mutant Bug Lair will continuously spawn and attack the player while fishing. To avoid this, fish right at the entrance before any bugs are triggered.

Tailoring
Slimejack can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the  Fishing Hat. It can be used in dyeing, serving as a green dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Slimejacks can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 3 days. The initial pond capacity is 1 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing four quests. When the population of the pond reaches 3, the color of the water changes to green. The primary output is green Slimejack Roe, but Green Algae is possible starting at population 3 and several more valuable items are possible starting at population 9.
