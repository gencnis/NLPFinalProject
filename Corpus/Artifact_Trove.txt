The Artifact Trove is an artifact container which can be purchased from the Desert Trader for 5 Omni Geodes, dropped by Haunted Skulls once the Vault Bundle is completed, found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm once the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least two times, or dug up from Artifact Spots in the Dig Site on Ginger Island.
Although most of the contents are artifacts, there are a few items, namely the Golden Pumpkin, Pearl, and Treasure Chest, which are not.
It can be broken open at the Blacksmith for 25g to obtain the contents inside. It cannot be broken open using a Geode Crusher.

Tailoring
Artifact Trove is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Trinket Shirt.  

Notes
By multiplying the sell price of each item by the chance to obtain it, the average profit of opening an Artifact Trove is 472.4g, or 447.4g when the 25g opening cost is factored in.
Since the average profit when breaking open an Omni Geode is 96.4g, and it takes five Omni Geodes to make one Artifact Trove (i.e., 482g), you will typically lose 35g every time you trade for one (if you are only selling the results).
History
1.4: Introduced.
1.5: Added Beach Farm and Ginger Island artifact spots to sources.
