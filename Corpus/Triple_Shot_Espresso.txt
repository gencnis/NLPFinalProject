Ingredients:

 Coffee (3)

Triple Shot Espresso is a cooked drink. It is prepared using either the kitchen inside an upgraded farmhouse or a Cookout Kit. Before it can be cooked, the recipe must be purchased from Gus while he's working the bar at the saloon for 5,000g.
Triple Shot Espresso can also be purchased at the Desert Trader in exchange for a Diamond, sometimes at the Stardew Valley Fair for 400, or at the Traveling Cart for 1,350-2,250g. 1-2 Triple Shot Espresso may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm if the player upgraded the Farmhouse at least once. Three Triple Shot Espresso is the reward for donating 70 items to the Museum. Wearing a Hot Java Ring gives a 7.5% chance for monsters to drop Triple Shot Espresso when killed.
When consumed, it grants the player +1 Speed for 4m 12s. The speed of the player's horse is also increased.
As a drink, its buff stacks with any food buffs (including Speed), but replaces any other drink buffs (i.e., from Coffee, Ginger Ale or Green Tea).
