Prismatic Jelly





Harvested from the rare and elusive prismatic slime.


Information 


Source:

Prismatic Slimes (100% drop)


Sell Price:

Cannot be sold


Prismatic Jelly will always drop from killing Prismatic Slimes. They are only obtainable while the Wizard's "Prismatic Jelly" Special Order quest is active.
Only one Prismatic Jelly is required for the Special Order, and any not handed to the Wizard will disappear once the order is complete or expired.
While the special order is active, each slime spawned in The Mines, Quarry Mine, or Skull Cavern has a 1.2% chance to be replaced with a Prismatic Slime, depending on daily luck.  The exact chance is 0.012 + Daily Luck / 10.0 [1].

Trivia
It is possible for a Prismatic Slime to be a special slime. In this case, the Prismatic Slime will only drop one of the special items and will not drop the intended Prismatic Jelly.
PC only: Prismatic Jelly can be spawned using the item ID glitch and gifted as a universally hated gift.
When killing a Prismatic Slime while wearing the Burglar's Ring, the slime will drop two Prismatic Jellies.
