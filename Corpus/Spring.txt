Spring is the season when players first begin the game. It's followed by Summer and preceded by Winter.
In Spring, the grass is green. Trees regain their leaves and bloom, and pink petals blow through the air on some days.  There is also a variety of crops, forageable items, and fish which only appear during this season. Salmonberry season lasts between the 15th-18th of Spring. When Spring starts, new logs, rocks and grass patches will spawn on the farm.

↑ The foraged items that can spawn in a given location each season are determined by GameLocation::spawnObjects in the game code, using input from the data file Content\Locations.xnb.  The percentages provided here have been normalized to ensure that the percentages sum to 100% for each location. The data was normalized by:
Calculating the sum of all percentages listed in Locations.xnb for Spring
Dividing each percentage by the sum
