Oak Resin is a Tree sap made from the Tapper when it is placed on an Oak Tree, taking  7-8 days.
Oak Resin can be obtained by tapping Oak Trees growing on The Farm or growing naturally in Stardew Valley (e.g., in Cindersap Forest). It is also a rare drop from Haunted Skulls, and can rarely be obtained after processing Hardwood in a Wood Chipper.
Although Oak Resin is labeled "Artisan Good" in-game, it does not benefit from the Artisan Profession, but instead from the Tapper Profession (+25% value).
