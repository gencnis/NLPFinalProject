Wood





A sturdy, yet flexible plant material with a wide variety of uses.


Information 


Source:

Trees • Carpenter's Shop


Sell Price:

2g


Wood is a basic resource that can be obtained by felling Trees and branches with an axe or bought from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop. It can also be found in Fishing Treasure Chests.  Ninety-nine wood can also be received as a gift from Robin at the Feast of the Winter Star.  One to 10 Wood can be produced in a Woodskip Fish Pond, depending on the population of the pond. Wood can additionally be obtained from chipped Hardwood and from recycled or chipped Driftwood.
Felling a normal-sized tree will give you between 13 and 17 wood, depending on daily Luck. After felling the tree, you can also destroy the stump which will give you between 5 and 7 wood. Be careful, as felling trees near water can result in the loss of some, or all of the wood. To prevent this, you can destroy the tree standing on the side where you do not want the tree to fall to, as it will always fall away from you. Contrary to popular belief, stumps will never grow back into full trees, either on The Farm or in areas outside the Farm. There is only one exception to this: mushroom tree stumps on the farm will always regrow to full mushroom trees on Spring 1, whether they became stumps in the first place by chopping or by the change of seasons.

The gold obtained by selling wood to Robin or through the Shipping Bin is unchanged.
