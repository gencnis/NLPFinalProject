Secret Woods








Closed:

Occupants:

 Old Master Cannoli


The Secret Woods is an outdoor area that can be entered from the northwest corner of Cindersap Forest. The entrance is initially blocked by a large log that can be cleared after upgrading to at least a Steel Axe.  
The Secret Woods contain seasonal forageables and Slimes that will attack the player. Slimes here have a chance of dropping Mahogany Seed when slain.
The Secret Woods contain six Large Stumps that regrow daily and can be harvested for a total of twelve Hardwood each day. Four stumps are in the upper part of the woods, and two are found by walking through one of two covered passages to a smaller lower area.  One passage is through the trees slightly southeast of the upper set of three stumps, and the other is south of the entrance to the woods, approximately 2-3 tiles to the right of a bush.  The former passage is a straight line, but the latter requires the player to walk south, then west, then south again.

Bear's Knowledge
After reading Secret Note #23 the "Strange Note" quest will activate. Entering the Secret Woods with Maple Syrup in inventory between 6am and 7pm with this quest active will result in a cutscene where the player encounters a grizzly bear who takes the maple syrup and thanks the player by sharing his special knowledge of berries. As a result, Bear's Knowledge is obtained, which permanently increases the sell price of blackberries and salmonberries by 3x.

Old Master Cannoli
Old Master Cannoli is a statue in the Secret Woods. When interacted with, it will give the description:




“

“--Old Master Cannoli--
...Still searching for the sweetest taste...”



If the statue is given a Sweet Gem Berry, a Stardrop is received in return. This will only occur once. In multiplayer games, only one Sweet Gem Berry is needed for all players to receive a Stardrop.

Foraging
 Locations in the Secret Woods where forageable items can spawn.
Forageable items found on the ground in the Secret Woods are:[1]

In Spring:  Wild Horseradish (52%),  Morel (32%), and  Common Mushroom (16%)
In Summer:  Fiddlehead Fern (78%), and  Red Mushroom (22%)
In Fall:  Common Mushroom (46%),  Chanterelle (38%), and  Red Mushroom (15%)
In Winter:  Holly (100%)
Forageable items spawn at an average rate of 0.8-1.4 per night, depending upon the season: 0.9 in spring, 1.0 in summer, 0.8 in fall, and 1.4 winter.[2] The map shows the possible locations as red tiles.

Artifact Spots
No Artifacts are possible when digging up Artifact Spots at the Secret Woods. Possible items are:

1-3  Clay (30-60%[3])
 Lost Book (20%); once all Lost Books have been found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by  Mixed Seeds.
Only in Winter:  Winter Root (24%)
Only in Winter:  Snow Yam (16%)
1-3  Stone (10-20%[3])
Only in Spring: 2-5  Rice Shoots (5%)
An unseen  Secret Note: up to 5% chance, only if the player has a Magnifying Glass.
Most of the year, there are only 8 tiles (near the pond) where artifact spots are possible, making them very rare, with an average rate of 0.01 per night. In winter the average rate increases to 0.7 per night.[4]

Villager Paths
No villagers walk through the Secret Woods, so items can be safely placed in any location.

Fishing
 Fishing Zones in the Secret Woods Pond.
Fishing is possible in the pond in the southwest area.  A unique fish, the Woodskip, can be caught here. Carp and Catfish are also possible. The available fish are the same year-round, even though Catfish is normally unavailable during summer.

In addition to this, the Wall Basket is a unique item that can be obtained from fishing here.

Bugs
With the addition of the ability to sit on chairs in 1.5, it is possible to enter the Secret Woods without needing the Steel Axe upgrade. Stand directly below the large log that blocks the path. Then place a chair on the other side of it. With the chair in place, it's possible to sit on it, effectively allowing the player to hop over the otherwise impassable obstruction after standing up again. The Secret Woods can be exited again using the same trick, by placing the chair on the forest side of the large log. The player can also use a bench to enter, but cannot exit with one.
