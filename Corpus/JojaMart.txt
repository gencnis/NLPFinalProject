JojaMart








Open Hours:

9:00am to 11:00pm


Closed:

After the player completes the Community Center


Address:

North of Blacksmith


Occupants:

 Morris


JojaMart is a store owned by "Joja Corporation", the player's previous employer. It is managed by Morris, who also handles customer service. The store is the main competitor of Pierre's General Store and sells a similar variety of seeds and other items, with JojaMart's key advantages being open longer (until 11pm) and on Wednesdays, however without Membership its prices are usually worse than Pierre's. Purchases can be made from the unnamed cashier found at checkout lane 3.
Morris can be found inside the kiosk at the bottom right of the store, where he will offer the player a JojaMart Membership for 5,000g.  Membership is available once the Community Center is unlocked. Purchasing a Joja Membership from Morris causes the Community Center to be destroyed and replaced with a Joja Warehouse.  The player can then purchase community development projects through the Joja Community Development Form, rather than through completing bundles in the Community Center.
Shane works there stocking shelves from 8:00 to 5:00 on weekdays. He also works on the weekend if it's raining. Sam sweeps from 12:50 to 5:00 on Mondays and Wednesdays. Both Sam and Shane are not available to talk to during their work time.

Trivia
On Fridays (before the Community Center is complete) Jodi may say, "The food at JojaMart might not be the healthiest for my family, but with such low prices you'd be crazy to shop anywhere else!" even though most items are more expensive at JojaMart than at Pierre's. She may, however, have a Joja membership or Pierre may offer the player discounts to encourage vegetable sales. This is further referenced to in Penny's dialogue "Since mom started shopping at JojaMart she's been able to afford more than shopping at Pierre's ever did!"
JojaMart does not sell Vinegar. This makes Pierre's the only place to obtain the cooking ingredient, as the player cannot craft it themselves.
The Steam achievement "Joja Co. Member Of The Year" requires purchasing all of the Joja Community Development Form projects, which takes at least six days; one day to build the Joja Warehouse after purchasing a Joja membership, and one day each for the five projects.
The 'Joja' logo has a striking similarity to WatchMojo's, a popular corporate YouTube channel.
There is no music of any kind inside of JojaMart.
It is possible to interact with the shelves to see what item it has on it.
A cold section in the back advertises "fish" and "milk," but neither product is available for sale to the player.
If the Community Center is completed, Sam goes to work at the Museum and Shane becomes unemployed.
JojaMart does not sell Blueberry Seeds.
Bugs
If the player purchases a JojaMart membership after completing the Community Center, but before triggering the Community Center completion ceremony cutscene, the cutscene may become glitched, with the player stuck in boxes that were not previously there.
