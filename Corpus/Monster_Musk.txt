Monster Musk is a crafted item used to encounter more monsters.  The recipe is earned after completing the Wizard's Special Order "Prismatic Jelly".
Monster Musk has a duration of 10 Minutes. If any player has the Monster Musk buff, the number of enemies on a given floor of the Mines, Skull Cavern, or the Volcano Dungeon when entering the level is doubled. [1]
It is a special-effect buff, meaning that drinking Monster Musk will not remove any buffs from consumed drinks or food, or vice-versa.
