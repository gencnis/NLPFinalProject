The Sea Urchin is a forageable item found year-round in the Tide Pool section of the Beach, i.e., to the east of the wooden footbridge[1].  During Summer 12-14 extra Sea Urchins appear anywhere on the beach (including possibly the western section).
The average spawn rate for Sea Urchin in the tide pool section of the beach is 0.23/day. An additional 0.8 (on average) Sea Urchins per day will spawn during Summer 12-14.  These spawn rates are not affected by the presence of other forageable items on the beach; in particular, Sea Urchins are not part of the standard six item per map limit on forageable items. 7 Foraging XP are granted for every Sea Urchin picked up, and all Foraging bonuses apply to Sea Urchins.
Emily may occasionally send you a Sea Urchin in the mail as a gift.  All saltwater Crab Pot fish may also produce a Sea Urchin in a Fish Pond, when the population of the pond reaches 5.

Tailoring
Sea Urchin can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Strapped Top.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as a purple dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Although Sea Urchins are not otherwise considered to be fish, they can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 4 days. The initial pond capacity is 10 Sea Urchins; no quests are necessary to increase the pond capacity. The only possible output is purple Sea Urchin Roe.
