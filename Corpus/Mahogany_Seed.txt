The Mahogany Seed is a seed that grows into a Mahogany Tree. It can be obtained by shaking or chopping down a Mahogany Tree, using an Axe or Pickaxe to dig up a Mahogany Seed dropped by a fully grown Mahogany Tree on The Farm, chopping a Large Stump or a Large Log, inside of a Golden Coconut, or killing Slimes in the Secret Woods.
Mahogany Seeds can also be purchased from the Island Trader for 1 Stingray. 
Unlike other fertilized tree seeds that have a 100% chance of growing to the next stage overnight, Mahogany Seeds fertilized with Tree Fertilizer have a 60% chance of growing to the next stage each night. Unfertilized seeds have a 15% chance of growing to the next stage.
