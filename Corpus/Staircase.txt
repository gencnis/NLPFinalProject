 Mining (Level 2)


Ingredients:

 Stone (99)


The Staircase is a craftable item used to instantly create a ladder that leads down one level in The Mines or Skull Cavern. It cannot be placed on level 0 or 120 of the mines.
Staircases work just like the game-supplied down-ladders. Each one works only for one use. Leaving the mine or returning to a higher level will result in the staircase being permanently gone. In addition, once a staircase has been placed, it cannot be picked up again, even if it has not been used.
Stone can be bought from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop if the player does not have enough.  In game year 1, the cost is 99 Stones × 20g = 1,980g per staircase.  In game year 2+, the cost is 99 Stones × 100g = 9,900g per staircase. The Desert Trader will trade staircases for one Jade each on Sundays.

Tips



Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

Use a staircase to evade one or more monster fights, especially infested floors. Some mine levels can be especially challenging. Consider upgrading weapons instead, though.
Use staircases in the Skull Cavern to descend quickly to lower levels for greater chances of valuable items, like Iridium Ore and Prismatic Shards.
When rapid descending/monster evading in the Skull Cavern note that staircases cannot be placed on the brickwork patterns and tillable areas in the floors of the cavern.
Using Jade from Crystalariums for staircases at the Desert Trader on Sundays and putting them in deconstructors can net the player massive amounts of stone quickly.
Secret
Placing a staircase in the pants slot of the player's inventory turns it into a secret clothing item.

History
1.4: Staircases can now be stacked in inventory and chests.
