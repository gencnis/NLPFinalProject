The Junimo Hut is a type of building purchasable from the Wizard at the Wizard's Tower after finishing the Goblin Problem Quest, and returning the bottle of ink from the witches hut to the wizard.
The hut houses Junimos, who live on the player's farm and harvest fully-grown crops that are within the hut's vicinity.

Services
The Junimos offer their services for harvesting mature crops. Crops include most plants grown on the farm, including flowers and tea leaves, plants that require a scythe to harvest, including fiber, and crops that grow on trellises. Unlike the player, Junimos are able to pass through tiles that contain a trellis or bush, so Junimo harvesting enables trellis plants to be densely planted where a player would be blocked.
The player does not gain any Farming experience points for a crop harvested by a Junimo. The quality of crops, however, is affected by the player's farming skill level, regardless who does the harvesting.
Junimo services can be turned off or on by clicking on the Hut and then clicking on the toggle button depicting a green Junimo harvesting a blueberry. 

This feature may be useful when planting, as players are not be able to plant a seed on a tile while a Junimo is standing on it, and are unable to cause the Junimo to move.

Service Limits
Junimos do not collect crops during winter or when it rains.
Junimos do not collect "forage" crops grown from Wild Seeds, neither do they collect anything grown in a Garden Pot. They also do not harvest any trees, for fruit, mushroom, seed, or wood.
Junimos are unable to harvest giant crops, whether Cauliflower, Melon, or Pumpkin, which require an axe. They can only harvest the normal-sized crops.

Harvesting
The vicinity of a hut is a 17x17 square of tiles centered on its doorway, 8 tiles in each direction plus the doorway itself. The building's footprint also covers one space to each side and above the doorway, six spaces in all. Thus, each Junimo Hut covers a maximum total region of 289 tiles: 283 plus the hut’s footprint.
Three Junimos emerge from each Junimo Hut first thing in the morning, each harvesting mature crops within range of the hut by picking them one at a time. They stop gathering at 7:10pm (as dark approaches), which is normally enough time to cover the entire area of the hut in a single day. However, Junimos are inefficient harvesters, and obstacles can lower their efficiency enough to prevent complete harvesting in one day. If the entrance to the hut is obstructed, the Junimos may be unable to gather crops at all. Junimos also cease activity if the player ends the game day earlier, or when the player attends a festival.

Collection
Players can retrieve crops from a hut whenever they'd like. A bag tied with a purple ribbon outside the southeast wall of the hut indicates that there are crops available for collection by the player. This bag holds up to 36 items, and behaves as though it were a Chest, in that players may take out or put things into it. If all 36 spaces in the bag are filled, the crops that the Junimos have harvested are dropped on the ground. The bag disappears after the player collects all goods.

Notes
It's not necessary to have 9 Starfruit of the same quality to build a Junimo Hut.  The game counts the total number of Starfruit in inventory.
Secret Note #24 hints at a secret ability of Junimos in Junimo Huts. Placing gems inside the Junimo Hut's storage slots changes the color of the Junimos.
The appearance of the Junimo Hut changes based on the season.
