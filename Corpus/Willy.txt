“

“A true angler has respect for the water... don't you forget that.”


— Willy


Willy is a villager who grew up traveling among the Fern Islands and now lives south of Pelican Town on The Beach. He sells bait and fishing supplies in his shop.  His shop is open every day but will be closed on Saturday if the weather is nice enough for him to go fishing.

Schedule
Most days Willy fishes at the beach for a few hours before operating his fish shop between 9am and 5pm. During winter he'll go to the saloon  after work.
Willy's shop is closed on Saturday while he's out fishing unless it's raining. Willy never visits the Beach Resort on Ginger Island, though he ferries other villagers to and from the Island.

Details 


Willy greets you outside the Fish Shop.  He says he needs your help and asks you to come inside.  Once inside, you see Crabs run amok, covering the Fish Shop floor.  Before you can do anything to help, Gus enters the Fish Shop and offers to purchase all the crabs, minus a discount for the labor involved.  Willy agrees, and Gus gathers the crabs.  Afterward, Gus turns to you and says he's going to run a special on Crab Cakes for the next few days (but not to tell Willy).  The cutscene ends with Willy saying goodbye to his "sweet ladies" as they are taken away to be killed and cooked.
Gus will sell an unlimited amount of Crab Cakes at the Saloon for 550g each starting on the day of the cutscene and for 3 days after.  Mayor Lewis will comment that he's smelled crab "all afternoon" the day the event is viewed.

Quotes


Regular 



First Meeting




“

“Ahoy there! It's nice to see young folk movin' in to the valley. It's not very common these days.”


Regular




“

“Ahoy there, [son/lass]. Looks like decent weather for fishing, eh?”





“

“Have you had much luck in the local waters? You look like you could be a strong angler if you set your mind to it.”





“

“A true angler has respect for the water... don't you forget that.”





“

“Some fish come and go with the seasons. Others only come out at night or in the rain.”





“

“*mumble* *mumble* ...Eh? I would tell you about my thoughts, but it's a fisherman's secret”





“

“ There are rumors of some very rare fish in these parts... but only an experienced angler could stand a chance against them. You'll need the finest bait you can get if you want a rare fish to bite.”





“

“If you really want to get the fish biting, make sure you put some bait on your hook.”





“

“If the local fishing scene got a bit more lively, I might expand the shop's stock.”





“

“If you purchase a high quality fishing rod, you'll be able to attach bait and tackle to the line. Bait causes fish to bite faster. Tackle can make your job a lot easier when reeling fish in. There are all kinds of tackle, with different perks. They're usually a little flimsy, so don't be surprised if your tackle breaks after a while.”


6+ Hearts




“

“The ol' Man was a fisherman, you know. I grew up sailing between the fern islands, living from catch to catch. The fishing life is tough, but there's something about it that keeps you goin'.”
