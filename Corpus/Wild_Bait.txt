5 Wild Bait per craft


Wild Bait is a type of bait that makes it possible to catch two fish at the same time and also makes fish bite slightly faster than standard bait.  Wild Bait can be crafted after being taught the recipe by Linus during his 4-heart cutscene. Once the recipe is known it is also possible to obtain Wild Bait from Fishing Treasure Chests. It is possible to find Wild Bait in artifact spots on Ginger Island even before triggering the cutscene with Linus.
Wild Bait cannot be used with the Training Rod or the Bamboo Pole. Only the Fiberglass Rod and the Iridium Rod can use bait. Wild bait can also technically be used in a Crab Pot, but it is no better than standard bait as crab pots never produce double fish.

Use
To attach bait to a fishing rod, open the inventory, click on the bait ( left-click or  right-click, depending on how many bait will be used), and then  on the rod.  To remove bait,  on the rod.  
Each cast uses one piece of bait or one magnet.  When all bait is used up, the game pops up a notification saying "You've used your last piece of bait."
On an Xbox controller, press  on the bait to select the whole stack (or  to pick up a single one), then  to attach to the rod.
On a PS4 controller, press  on the bait to select the whole stack (or  to pick up a single one), then  to attach to the rod.
On a Nintendo Switch Controller, Press  on the bait to select the whole stack (Or  to pick up a single one), then  to attach to the rod.
Bait can be detached by pressing  on either Controller. ( on Nintendo Switch)
For the mobile version, bait can be added to the fishing rod by opening the inventory, then dragging the bait and dropping it on top of the rod.


Effect
Using Wild Bait reduces the delay before a nibble by 62.5%. There is also a chance to catch two fish, equal to 0.25 + Daily Luck / 2.0 [1].  The chance to catch 2 fish does not apply to Legendary Fish. It can however, catch 2 of the semi-Legendary fish caught from the Extended Family quest line.
Note that catching two fish does not grant double Fishing Experience points.
Catching two fish with Wild Bait while working on a fishing or special order quest counts both fish toward the required total.
