“

“One time... I was at the top of the volcano at night, and I saw lights far, far away.  I wonder if there are other bird families out there?”


— Leo


Leo is a boy who initially lives on Ginger Island.  His parents were lost at sea, and he considers the parrots who inhabit the island to be his family.  Initially, he is too shy to speak to the player, until the player "makes friends" with the parrots of the island by giving them Golden Walnuts. This is done by giving 10 Golden Walnuts to the first parrot outside by the turtle.
When the player reaches six hearts of friendship with Leo, he moves to the mainland of Stardew Valley, where he becomes friends with Linus, Jas and Vincent.

Heart Events

Enter Island West on a sunny day between 6am and 6pm.

Just enjoying the waves. (No effect on friendship.)
Looking for fish. (No effect on friendship.)
Thinking about someone special. (No effect on friendship.)
Pondering the big questions. (No effect on friendship.)
Leo then asks what the player's home is like.

There's a town full of people. (No effect on friendship.)
There's forests, beaches, and mountains. (No effect on friendship.)
It's like here, but colder. (No effect on friendship.)
I live on a farm. (No effect on friendship.)
Leo thinks about your words for a bit before asking if there are any kids in Pelican Town

Yes. (No effect on friendship.)
What does that matter to a bird? (No effect on friendship.)
Regardless of the answer, Leo says he's aware he's not really a bird, and he tries to avoid thinking about it because it makes him feel lonely. He tries to fit in with the parrots, but knows he truly doesn't belong anywhere. He runs off before Willy enters the scene, wondering if there's any way to help him.


Three Hearts

After reaching three hearts with Leo, he sends the player a recipe in the mail.

Four Hearts

Enter Island North on a sunny day between 6am and 6pm.



Details 


The player approaches Leo from behind. Leo squawks like a parrot and startles the player, which startles Leo in turn. Leo then apologizes and explains that he has difficulty communicating using words, then asks the player if they find him weird. Leo wonders about the differences in his life if he hadn't been washed ashore and wonders about what "normal kids" would have to say about him. Leo then asks the player if they think he could ever be a normal kid again. After the player answers, he states that he's happy he met the parrots regardless, and that he will always consider them family no matter what. Leo thanks the player for talking to him and says that the player may be a part of his family too, someday. He then teaches the player how to say "let's play" in parrot-talk.
Note that none of the dialogue options in this cutscene affect friendship with Leo.


Six Hearts

Enter Island South on a sunny day between 6am and 6pm.



Details 


Linus invites Leo to move to the mainland of Stardew Valley.  Willy says that there are other children there, and Leo can visit Ginger Island anytime he wants to.  Willy asks the player what they think.  (Choices have no effect on friendship).
Leo decides to move to Stardew Valley.  That night, parrots build him a treehouse in the tree to the west of Linus' tent.

The scene after has him watching Jas from the bushes in the playground, and running away when she notices. He arrives home at the treehouse and talks to his parrot friend about how good his day was, but he still misses Ginger Island.

“Hi... Everything okay?”

“

“...Sorry... I'm shy today.”





“

“...I'm sad today. You go on... have fun. Let me be sad.”





“

“I've learned a lot from my parrot family... I'm sure there's a lot more out there I don't know.”





“

“Be careful in the volcano... the spirits don't like outsiders.”





“

“Have you met the others like you? I don't talk to them much. I feel safer with my own kind...”





“

“One time... I was at the top of the volcano at night, and I saw lights far, far away. I wonder if there are other bird families out there?”





“

“I wonder if I could see your home from the top of the volcano?”





“

“When it rains, strange birds visit. I try to speak to them... but they fly away. I guess they don't want to be friends...”



6+ Hearts - Mainland




“

“Miss Penny is doing her best to get me up to speed in my schooling. She's really nice.... ..Luckily, I remember some things from my old, old life... before washing up on the island... so it's not as difficult as it could be. Miss Penny says she's impressed with how much I know!”





“

“Between Linus and Miss Penny, I'm going to learn everything there is to learn! Mayor Lewis says I'm on the fast track to becoming a 'well-rounded citizen'... whatever that means.”





“

“Have you ever noticed all the interesting birds that live here? If you listen closely, they might tell you something.”





“

“Linus has been teaching me about all the wild food in the valley. There's a lot of good stuff out here! Though... I do kind of miss having golden walnuts for breakfast every morning...”

“Hey, [Player]. Nice to see you back on the island, just like old times. This is fun! You know, I was scared when you first arrived... I knew my life was about to change.”





“

“You know, Stardew Valley might be my new home... but the island will always be my home, too. It's nice to be able to come back and visit.”





“

10 Hearts - Mainland




“

“I felt like a stranger here, at first. But I've made a lot of friends! For once, I feel like I belong...”





“

“I'm sure Jas and Vincent thought I was weird, at first. I accidentally squawked at the school table a few times... that didn't help. It was a big change for everyone. But we're good friends now!”





“

“The parrots want me to thank you for all the golden walnuts you've found. They're really enjoying them.”





“

“[Player]? Um... I'm a little embarrassed to ask.. But... do you think Jas would ever like a guy like me? Or am I too weird? Hahaha... who cares. I'll figure it out some day.”


Winter




“

“The birds of this valley don't mind the cold so much. I'm a little jealous of their warm coats...”

Portraits






















Trivia
Leo may still tell you it's nice to see you on the island again when you're both on the mainland, particularly when its raining and his normal schedule dictates he would be on the island that day.
In the player's initial dialogue with Leo, if asked how old he is, he responds "We don't think like that. We say... 'How many golden walnuts have you eaten?' ...I've eaten 3,729 golden walnuts."
Despite the ambiguity of his age, Leo is classified within the game's code as a child.
History
1.5: Introduced.
1.5.3: Now likes Mango Sticky Rice and is neutral to Coffee as gifts.
