Tailoring
Pancakes are used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Track Jacket.    It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
Pancakes are not used in any quests.

Notes
While this recipe is not profitable, it is the cheapest way to gain a +2 Foraging boost. This can translate into high effective profit when shaking Salmonberry or Blackberry bushes during their respective seasons, since an additional berry will be harvested at Foraging levels 4, 8, and 12.

History
1.4: Recipe price reduced from 500g to 100g.  Can now be used in Tailoring. Harvey now dislikes it as a gift.
1.5: Can now be prepared using a Cookout Kit.
