Artifacts
This tab keeps track of the type and amount of Artifacts collected.  Entries are added upon finding the artifact.  The artifact does not need to be donated to the Museum or shipped via the shipping bin to count towards the collection.
Note that artifacts found in Fishing Treasure Chests, obtained by tilling soil in the mines, or found in Artifact Troves may not appear as found on the collections tab.  Dragging the artifact outside the inventory window and allowing it to be taken back into inventory may correct this.  Holding the artifact in inventory overnight may also correct this.
Note also that artifacts' descriptions appear on the collections tab as soon as they are found, even while the inventory description says "Gunther can tell you more about this if you donate it to the museum."

Minerals
This tab keeps track of the type and amount of Minerals collected.  Entries are added when the mineral is taken into inventory.  The mineral does not need to be shipped or donated to the Museum to be registered.
Note that minerals found in Fishing Treasure Chests may not appear as found on the collections tab.  Dragging the mineral outside the inventory window and allowing it to be taken back into inventory may correct this.  Holding the mineral in inventory overnight may also correct this.
Note also that minerals' descriptions appear on the collections tab as soon as they are found, even while the inventory description says "Gunther can tell you more about this if you donate it to the museum."
