 Fishing (Level 8)


Ingredients:

 Copper Bar (1) Iron Bar (1) Gold Bar (1)


The Barbed Hook is a tackle that helps fishing by keeping the fishing bar attached to the catch. It can be crafted or purchased from Willy's Fish Shop for 1,000g after reaching Fishing level 8. It may also randomly appear at the Traveling Cart for 1,500-2,500g. 
A Barbed Hook is one of the rewards the player gets the first time they win the fishing competition at the Festival of Ice.
Only the Iridium Rod can equip tackle. To attach tackle to an Iridium Rod, left-click on the tackle, then right-click on the Iridium Rod. To remove tackle, first right-click to remove any bait, then right-click to remove the tackle.
Tackle does not stack in inventory or chests; each tackle takes up one inventory slot.

Bundles

Quests
The Barbed Hook is not used in any quests.

Notes
The fishing bar can be moved manually while a Barbed Hook is in use, although it is more difficult, especially with slower fish.  The more the fish darts up and down, the easier it is to move the fishing bar manually, and the less effective the Barbed Hook is.
Crafting and selling a Barbed Hook is 70g more profitable than selling 1 Copper Bar, 1 Iron Bar, and 1 Gold Bar without the Blacksmith Profession. With the Blacksmith Profession, it is cheaper to sell the bars individually instead of crafting a Barbed Hook.
