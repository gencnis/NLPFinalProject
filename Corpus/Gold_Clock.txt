Constructing the Gold Clock is necessary to achieve Perfection.

Behavior
When placed, the Gold Clock:

Prevents debris from appearing on the farm and the Ginger Island farm.
Grass is a natural resource, not debris, so it continues to appear randomly.
Trees no longer randomly appear on the farms, though they can still be manually planted and continue to grow. Trees continue to sprout automatically off the farms as before.
Keeps all fences from decaying, so they never need repair.
Keeps time with the in-game clock.
