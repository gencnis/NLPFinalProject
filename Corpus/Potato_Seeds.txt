Potato Seeds are a type of seed. Mature plants yield Potatoes.
Potato Seeds can be purchased at Pierre's General Store, JojaMart, from the Magic Shop Boat at the Night Market on Winter 15, and occasionally from the Traveling Cart. They can also be obtained by using the Seed Maker, as well as having a chance of being planted when using Mixed Seeds.  Five to twenty Potato Seeds may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern.

Stages
When harvested, each Potato plant gives 1 potato, with a random chance to produce extra potatoes, partially based on Daily Luck.[1]

Notes

↑ The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.2, then another Potato will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.2, at which point the chance for an extra Potato ends. This, on average, will give 0.25 extra Potatoes. Keep in mind that Daily Luck can also double the amount of extra Potatoes spawned by the above formula.
