Bug
When selling Sunflower Seeds to Pierre, seeds collected by harvesting Sunflowers or purchased from Pierre sell for 20g each.  However, seeds purchased from JojaMart sell for 100g.  Thus, if you purchase one seed from JojaMart, then add collected seeds to that stack in inventory, all the seeds will sell for 100g each.
If you instead add the purchased seed to the stack of collected seeds (or seeds purchased from Pierre), all the seeds will sell for 20g each.
History
1.0: Introduced.
1.1: Made plantable in summer in addition to fall.
1.4: Sunflower Seeds purchased from Pierre now sell back to him for 20g instead of 100g.
