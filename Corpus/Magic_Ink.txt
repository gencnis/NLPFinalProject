Magic Ink








Information 


Source:

Witch's Hut


Sell Price:

Cannot be sold


Magic Ink can be found on a table in the Witch's Hut after completing the quest Goblin Problem.  It can be returned to the Wizard in exchange for his gratitude.  Returning the Ink also unlocks several new Farm Buildings that can be purchased from a book on a stand in the Wizard's Tower.
Once obtained, it can be found in the wallet in the The Player's Menu on the Skills tab.  Oddly enough, it remains in the wallet after returning it to the Wizard.
