The Fairy Rose is a flower that can be grown from Fairy Seeds in 12 days. 
If grown within proper range of a Bee House (5 squares in any cardinal direction), a Fairy Rose will cause Fairy Rose Honey to be produced, increasing the honey base value from 100g to 680g. This is the most valuable type of honey, compensating for the poor profit margins on the flower itself.
Fairy Roses can be purchased from the Traveling Cart for 870-1,450g.
