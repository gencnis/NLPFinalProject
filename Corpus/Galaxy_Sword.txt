The Galaxy Sword is a sword weapon that can be obtained by taking a Prismatic Shard to the Three Pillars in the Calico Desert. While holding the shard, enter the centermost tile between the three pillars. The Prismatic Shard will be consumed.
After obtaining a Galaxy Sword, players will not be able to use a Prismatic Shard to obtain another. If lost or sold, another sword may be purchased from Marlon for 50,000g.
Obtaining a Galaxy Sword unlocks the Galaxy Hammer and Galaxy Dagger in the Adventurer's Guild shop.
