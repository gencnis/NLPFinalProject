Unmilled Rice is a vegetable crop that grows from Rice Shoots  after 8 days (6 when irrigated). Unmilled Rice is harvested using a Scythe.
Players have the ability to craft Rice from Unmilled Rice by using a Mill. Once placed in the Mill, one Unmilled Rice will make one Rice. Rice will appear in the box on the right side of the Mill the following morning.

Rice

A basic grain often served under vegetables.

 Unmilled Rice (1)

 Mill

Ready the next morning

100g

Tailoring
Unmilled Rice can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Shirt And Belt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Quests
Unmilled Rice may be randomly requested in Spring at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 90g and 150 Friendship points.
Notes
If grown from Rice Shoots purchased from Pierre's, it is only profitable to sell gold quality Unmilled Rice directly. With the Tiller Profession, silver quality Unmilled Rice becomes profitable by 1g.  In all cases it is profitable to process Unmilled Rice into Rice using a Mill, or Pickles using a Preserves Jar.
The day you harvest an Unmilled Rice from an irrigated tile, the tile retains the irrigation water. Anything you plant there that same day will not need watering.
References

↑ The game generates a random number between 0 and 1, and if it is less than 0.1, then another Unmilled Rice will spawn. This repeats until the random number is greater than or equal to 0.1, at which point the chance for an extra Unmilled Rice ends. This, on average, will give 0.11 extra Unmilled Rice. Keep in mind that Luck can also double the amount of extra Unmilled Rice spawned by the above formula.


History
1.4: Introduced.
1.4.2: Gift taste changed to universal dislike.
1.5: Iridium quality is now possible when using Deluxe Fertilizer.  Bugfix for Agriculturist stages of growth.
