Tailoring
Lingcod can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the Fishing Vest.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Lingcod can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 3 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The primary output is dark brown Lingcod Roe, but Bug Meat is also possible starting at population 9.

Quests
Willy requests a Lingcod by mail on the 13th of Winter (year 2) in the "Catch a Lingcod" Quest.  The reward is 550g and 1 Friendship heart. Note that you can use a Lingcod caught before the quest was accepted.
Aquatic Overpopulation: Demetrius may request 10 Lingcod to be caught in Winter at the Special Orders board outside the Mayor's Manor for a reward of gold equivalent to selling the fish and the Farm Computer recipe.
Trivia
