Notes
If Pam is at her doctor's appointment or visiting Ginger Island the bus will not run. This means that you can only travel to the desert by using a Warp Totem: Desert or Desert Obelisk.
On Winter 25, despite the Feast of the Winter Star, Pam will still drive the bus as on her regular schedule, allowing the player access to the desert.
Emily visits Sandy in the desert on Sandy's birthday (Fall 15), closing the store at 1pm.
