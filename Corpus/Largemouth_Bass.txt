The Largemouth Bass is a fish that can be caught in the mountain lake during all seasons. It comprises approximately 19% to 20% of all catches there during Spring and Fall, but drops to around 15% during Summer and Winter. It is most likely to be caught when casting farther from shore.[1] It can also be caught on the Wilderness Farm. It may be randomly be found in Garbage Cans, or at the Traveling Cart for 300-1,000g. 
Largemouth Bass can be caught regardless of time of day using Magic Bait.
