Tailoring
Dorado can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Fish Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Dorado can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every 3 days. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing three quests. The primary output is orange Dorado Roe, but Bug Meat is also possible starting at population 9.
