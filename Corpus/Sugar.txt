 Mill


Time to Craft:

 Ready the next morning


Ingredients:

 Beet (1)


Produces:

3 Sugar per Beet


Sugar is a cooking ingredient that can be used in a variety of recipes. It can be purchased year round from Pierre's General Store for 100g or from JojaMart for 125g. 4-7 Sugar may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse at least once.
Players have the ability to craft Sugar from Beets by using a Mill. Once placed in the mill, one Beet will make three Sugar. Beets placed inside will appear as Sugar in the box beside the Mill the next morning.
Note: Sugar made using the mill is profitable when using regular or silver quality beets, at 150g for three sugar it has a higher sell price than 1 beet at regular or silver quality even with the Tiller Profession. However, this is far less than the 250g sell price of beet pickles made using the Preserves Jar.
