The Golden Egg is an animal product obtained from Golden Chickens. Golden chickens will produce a golden egg every day as long as they are fed.
To obtain Golden Eggs and Golden Chickens, Perfection must have been achieved. Progress can be tracked in Qi's Walnut Room.
After reaching Perfection, the first Golden Egg can be obtained in four ways:

Marnie's Ranch for 100,000g.
Qi's Walnut Room for  100.
Random Event that occurs after the player goes to sleep. A golden witch will fly over a Coop and leave a Golden Egg inside.
Randomly from a Fishing Treasure Chest (0.12% chance).
Golden Eggs can be put into an incubator in a Big or Deluxe Coop to hatch a Golden Chicken 6 days later, or 3 days with the Coopmaster Profession.
