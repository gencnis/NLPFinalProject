Overview
There are 120 floors (sometimes called levels) in the Mines. Ore type and quantity increases as The Player moves deeper into the Mines. The Mines are filled with rocks and dirt patches. Rocks can be mined with a  Pickaxe in order to obtain Stone, ore and Geodes. A Hoe can be used on dirt patches to collect Minerals, Artifacts, ore, Clay, and Cave Carrots.
To advance deeper in the Mines, a ladder must be revealed on each floor. The ladder will appear after breaking rocks or after defeating an enemy (killing enemies is the stamina-free option to finding ladders). If a floor is "infested" or "overrun" by monsters, all enemies must be defeated on that floor before a ladder will appear. (Note, however, that there is a bug that affects very few floors where a ladder will drop before all enemies are killed.)
Passing out in the Mines from exhaustion (zero Energy) or when 2:00AM arrives will result in 10% of gold lost up to a maximum of 1,000g. Passing out from drained Health will result in losing anywhere between 5%-25% of gold (up to a maximum of 5,000g)[1] and also various inventory items, including Weapons and Tools (except for the Galaxy Sword). If tools are lost, they are returned in the mail on the following day, though Fishing Poles and weapons will not be returned.  The character will awaken in the mine entrance, found by one of the villagers.
Lost items can be recovered by contacting Marlon at the Adventurer's Guild.  One lost item (or stack of items) can be purchased there, any time after passing out due to low health. The price is the base sell price of the lost item (i.e., the gold that would be obtained from selling one item or stack of items).  Marlon's Item Recovery Service persists until the next time the player loses items in the Mines, when previously lost items are replaced by newly lost items.
A Minecart is located on the entry floor for quick travel to and from the mine. It is unlocked after completing the Boiler Room Bundles or by purchasing "Minecarts" from the Joja Community Development Form at JojaMart for 15,000g.

Floors
The Mines consist of 120 floors (sometimes called levels). These floors are divided into three sections, 40 floors each, with their own themes; the first section has a brown earth theme, the second section has a frozen theme, and the third and last section has a lava and dark purple theme. The last 10 floors of each section has a variation of the main theme; the first section (Floor 31-39) has a shadow theme, the second section (70-79) has a castle theme, and the third and last section (110-119) has a darker crimson theme.
The corresponding floors in each section have the same layout. For example, Floor 5, 45, and 85 have the same layout; as does 19, 59, and 99; or Floor 31, 71, and 111; and so on.

Ladders
Ladders can be dropped from Monsters[2], Rocks[3], or spawned on load[4]
Every monster killed has a 15% chance of spawning a ladder, assuming the enemy was killed over an unobstructed tile. This does not prevent ladders spawning from rocks.
Some floors are preloaded with a ladder (12, 52, 92, treasure rooms in Skull Cavern). These ladders do not prevent ladders spawning from rocks.
After a floor loads, there is a 95% chance that a ladder will attempt to spawn. A tile is chosen at random, and if it is unobstructed then a ladder is placed. This will prevent ladders spawning from rocks.
Every rock hit has a base chance of 2% to spawn a ladder. This is adjusted by daily Luck, increasing by 2% at best or decreasing by 2% at worst with the Special Charm adding 0.5%. Food buffs add 1% for every point of Luck. The inverse of the number of rocks remaining after the rock is hit is added (e.g., if 5 rocks remaining then 1/5 = 0.2 or 20%, if 100 rocks remaining then 1/100 = 0.01 or 1%). If no enemies remain then 4% is added. If this chance hits, then a ladder will spawn, and prevent further ladders spawning from rocks. In Skull Cavern, there is a 20% chance that a shaft will spawn instead of a ladder, and this does not prevent further ladders/shafts spawning from rocks.

Crates and Barrels
Containers in the Mines may randomly drop loot when destroyed. Containers are equally likely to be crates or barrels; the possible contents are not affected by the type of container. At most one type of item will be dropped by a crate, although one stack may contain multiple items.
Most containers respawn every time a level is entered. Containers on reward floors in the Mines, however, are only spawned the first time entering there. After those containers are destroyed, no new containers will appear on these levels.
Some items replace others depending on if the player has reached the bottom of The Mines. Where there are two values, the first is before reaching the bottom of The Mines, the second is after.  The possible items found in containers and their chances are[5]:

A small fraction of crates and barrels (2.2%) will drop one of the following special items[6].  Visually these crates and barrels are indistinguishable from containers containing standard loot.
These special items can also be dropped by a small fraction of monsters.  About 1.2% of Slimes are identifiable as Special Slimes by gold stars.  For all other monsters, less than 0.2% of monsters will drop special items instead of standard loot, but these special monsters look identical to the standard versions.

Infested Floors
 Entering an infested floor.
Occasionally the player will enter an infested floor filled with slimes or a mix of monsters. Unlike normal floors, there are no rocks and in slime-infested floors, the walls and ground are covered in green slime rather than the normal themes. Forageable items such as Quartz or Mushrooms may still be found. 
To proceed from an infested floor, all monsters must be killed (this includes Duggies that may be hidden under dirt patches). Note that a bug causes the guaranteed ladder on floors 12, 52, and 92 to still appear once the level loads even if said floor is infested. Once all monsters are killed, a ladder will appear either where the last monster was killed or next to the entrance. If it appears next to the entrance the player will be notified with a message saying, "A way down has appeared". If it appears where the last monster was killed and the player does not enter the ladder immediately, after some time it is possible for a second ladder to appear near the entrance and a message notifying the player "A way down has appeared".
A Staircase can also be used to escape an infested floor. 
The Oil of Garlic Buff prevents floors from being infested.  Oil of Garlic must be consumed before entering the floor to prevent infestation.
In rare cases, there may be no monsters on an infested floor. In this case, a ladder will appear next to the entrance shortly after entering the level, along with the message "A way down has appeared".
There is no pattern for when infested floors appear, but infested floors will remain infested for the entire day. Infested floors cannot spawn on elevator floors (floors ending in 0 or 5), nor can they spawn on the first 5 levels, the 19th level, or the last 10 levels of each section of the mine.[8] This includes levels 1-4, 41-44, 81-84 (the first 5 levels), levels 19, 59, 99 (the 19th level), and levels 31-39, 71-79, 111-119 (the last 10 levels), as well as Skull Cavern levels using the same layout as these levels.
Repeatedly visiting infested floors can be an excellent way to quickly achieve some of the Monster Eradication Goals at the Adventurer's Guild.

The Mushroom Floor
 A mushroom floor.
Any floor in the lowest section of the Mines (levels 81-119), excluding elevator floors, has a 3.5% chance of generating as a mushroom floor, provided the same floor hasn't been generated as a mushroom floor before on the same day.[9]
Mushroom floors will have greatly increased spawns of red and purple mushrooms. These floors will also have a variety of colored lanterns which usually includes at least one green lantern.
The mushroom floor will only spawn the first time a player visits the floor and will disappear immediately after leaving it.

Dungeon Floors
 A dungeon floor.
Dungeon floors are a type of floor similar in appearance to the single floor of the Quarry Mine. Any eligible floor in the Mines has a 4.4% chance of generating as a dungeon floor after the Quarry has been unlocked. These floors have the same enemies and rocks as the Quarry Mine and can often be considerably harder than those of the floors they replace. Dungeon floors are never infested.[8]
As with infested floors, dungeon floors cannot spawn on elevator floors or the first floor. They will also remain as dungeon floors for the entire day. However, unlike infested floors, dungeon floors can spawn on floors 2-4, 42-44, and 82-84, 19, 59, and 99, 31-39, 71-79, and 111-119 (excluding floors 35, 75, and 115, as they are elevator floors).
Players without high-level tools or weapons might benefit from using a Staircase to skip these floors to save time.

The Bottom of the Mines
On floor 120 of the Mines is the Skull Key. The skull key is used to open a door in a cave in The Desert, leading to the Skull Cavern. It is also used to unlock the Junimo Kart arcade machine for play in The Stardrop Saloon.
Furthermore, reaching this floor also changes other parts of the game:

Prismatic Shards and Diamonds will rarely drop from any monster;
Gems may be found when searching Garbage Cans;
Gems may be requested on the Help Wanted board outside Pierre's General Store;
Most monsters will be stronger[10]. Specifically:
Defense will be increased by 50%
Chance of missing a hit (i.e., doing no damage with a hit) will be doubled
HP will be increased by a random value between 0 and 100%
Damage will be increased by a random value between 0 and 50%
These changes are permanent, and will not reset even if the "Danger In The Deep" quest is active (which resets the mine elevator).

Shrine of Challenge



Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

 The Shrine of Challenge
The Shrine of Challenge is unlocked after unlocking Qi's Walnut Room and completing the "Danger In The Deep" quest. It is located on floor 120 of the Mines and acts as a toggle switch, alternating the strengths of enemies between normal levels and "dangerous" levels. The toggle does not change strength levels until the following day.
While the dangerous setting is active, Radioactive Nodes can be found in the Mines, from which Radioactive Ores can be obtained.
On the day the player first completes the "Danger In The Deep" quest, a note from Mr. Qi can be found on the shrine saying he has temporarily disabled the shrine and the player can come back tomorrow.

Strategy
Swarms
If the screen becomes "misty", "glowy", or "foggy", several of the current floor's flying monsters will spawn and attack.  Consuming Oil of Garlic will prevent these infestation fogs.

Staircases
If the Player has reached at least Mining skill level 2, floors can be skipped by using Staircases (crafted from 99 Stone). A staircase allows instant access to the next floor in the Mines. After every 5 floors, an elevator will be available, allowing access to that floor at any time.

Food
Shown below are foods with Buffs that are useful when exploring the Skull Cavern. Note that eating a food with buffs will wipe out any active buffs and replace them with the buffs from the newly eaten food. If the newly eaten food has no buffs, the existing buffs will remain in effect. Coffee, Triple Shot Espresso and Ginger Ale are an exception to this rule; they will stack with other food Buffs (but not each other).

Bugs
An infested floor on floors 12, 52, or 92 at the Mines (floors preloaded with a ladder) will still have the ladder preloaded. This makes it possible to descend from that floor without killing all of the enemies or using a staircase. Killing all of the enemies on the floor will result in a second ladder spawning.
Trivia
The axe, scythe or pickaxe can be used to kill monsters in lieu of a weapon.
Stone can be purchased from the Carpenter's Shop for 20g each during year 1, making it possible to skip all 120 floors using Staircases for just under 225,000g (useful for unlocking all the floors in order to return later).
Starting in year 2, the price of stone increases to 100g, making this a much more expensive technique (1,125,000g).
Monsters become more difficult to kill with increased damage after reaching the bottom of the Mines[10], so this technique is not without penalties.
If all monsters on a floor are killed, the chance of finding a ladder under a broken rock is increased by 4%.[11]
At floor 120, both the Green Serpent Statue and the Purple Serpent Statue are found.

History
1.3.27: Removed exploit that created a ladder to the Skull Cavern on floor 120 by blowing up an item with a bomb. Added several changes that happen after reaching the bottom of the mines, specifically rare prismatic shard/diamond now rarely drop from any monster, gems/purple mushrooms are now found in garbage cans and can be requested by NPC quests, and some monsters becoming stronger.
1.4: Added random dungeon (quarry mine) levels.  Changed the way mushroom levels are spawned, so they cannot be repeatedly "farmed".  Removed exploit where clicking the journal icon would prevent the passing out (from low health) cutscene where items and gold were lost.  Mine levels are no longer forgotten when passing out due to low health.  Added Marlon's Item Recovery Service.  Mine floors now also reset as soon as the player returns to floor 0, instead of only the next 10-minute tick of the game clock when on a lower numbered floor.
1.5: In the Advanced Options when starting a farm, there is an option for Mine Rewards to be Default or Remixed.  Added Shrine of Challenge to floor 120 after completing Qi quest.
1.5.5: Fixed issue where the hardmode mines could be permanently enabled and be unable to be changed back.
