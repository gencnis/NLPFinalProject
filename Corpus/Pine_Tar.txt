Pine Tree


Pine Tar is a Tree sap made from a Tapper placed on a Pine Tree. The process takes  5-6 days.
Pine Tar can be obtained by tapping Pine Trees growing on The Farm or growing naturally in Stardew Valley (e.g., in Cindersap Forest, the Railroad, around the Carpenter's Shop). It can also rarely be obtained after processing Hardwood in a Wood Chipper.
Although Pine Tar is labeled "Artisan Good" in-game, it does not benefit from the Artisan Profession, but instead from the Tapper Profession (+25% value).
