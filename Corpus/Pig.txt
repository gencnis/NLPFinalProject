Pigs work differently than other barn animals. Instead of generating a product inside of the barn, they dig up truffles outside of the barn and leave them on the ground.

Location
Pigs have a chance to dig up a truffle on every farm that they are left outside (more info below). This means that each day, the location of any generated truffles will be random, based on where the pig has walked. It is not necessary to stay on the farm for pigs to produce truffles.
Optionally, fences or other obstacles can be used to constrain the movement of pigs coming out of the barn. This can be useful in that it concentrates the area where they can produce truffles.
Importantly, truffles cannot be produced on tiles that contain debris or other objects (not including crafted flooring or pathing). Thus, to guarantee that a pig produces a truffle, ensure that it is travelling over mostly uncovered tiles during its daytime walk.
Note that while the truffle appears front of the pig, the tile checked for debris is where the pig stands. If the tile in front of the pig is occupied (e.g., by a fence) the truffle is instead placed one tile further. If that tile is occupied, the truffle is placed one tile further, and so on. This can lead to truffles being spawned outside a fenced area.
Prerequisites for Truffle Generation
A pig will only produce a truffle if all of the following are true:

the pig has been fed
the pig has been let outside the barn
it is not raining/storming
it is not winter
there are available tiles outside with which to place a truffle
Chance to Produce the First Truffle
A pig has a 0.02% chance on each frame to generate a truffle if:

it has not yet generated a truffle for the day
it is standing on a free tile
This means that there is around a 99.99% chance that a pig will generate a truffle each day, with the assumption that it is walking around on mostly free tiles. Friendship does not affect this check; a pig with 0 friendship will still have a 99.99% chance to generate one truffle per day.

Chance to Produce Extra Truffles
Once a pig has found the first truffle for the day, it can continue to find truffles.
The chance to find an extra truffle is Animal Friendship / 1500. This means that at max friendship (1000), there is a 66% chance of creating an extra truffle.
Multiple extra truffles can be made until the animal fails this check.
The average number of truffles a pig at max happiness produces in a day is ≈3 [1].
Professions
Truffles benefit from professions such as Gatherer, allowing for double harvest, as well as Botanist, making all Truffles iridium quality.
However, Truffles do not benefit from the Rancher profession.
Gathering Frequency
Truffles that are not gathered will stay on the ground until the next day. This means that a player can continually let Truffles build up, and then collect them all at once.
However, truffles that are not gathered on the 28th day of a season disappear on the following morning (the 1st day of the new season).
Reproduction
Pigs, like all other animals except rabbits, have a low chance to reproduce and can produce baby pigs. The more animals there are inside the same barn, the higher the chance an animal will give birth.

Selling
Pigs can be sold. The selling price is dependent on how many hearts the animal has (20,800g max).
To sell a coop or barn animal, right-click the animal after petting. The friendship/mood interface appears. Move the cursor over the gold coin button at the right to see how much you can sell the animal for. Click that button and the confirmation that follows to complete the sale.
