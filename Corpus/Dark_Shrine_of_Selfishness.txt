The Dark Shrine of Selfishness is an altar found in the Witch's Hut. It can be accessed after completing the Goblin Problem quest. The player can offer a Prismatic Shard to turn their children into doves, which permanently removes them from the game.

Secrets
After turning children into doves, two secret events may occur.



While watching TV... 


On the Standard Farm: Watching TV on Fall 26 and choosing "???" will display an Ancient Doll on the TV screen, along with an eerie message:



“

“You've brought this upon yourself... now I'm free... Hee hee hee!”


After this message, an Ancient Doll will pop out of the TV.  Thereafter, there will be a cursed Ancient Doll in front of the Dark Shrine of Selfishness, which will fly around and attack the player.  When slain, this Ancient Doll will turn into a large black bird and fly away.  Exiting and re-entering the Witch's Hut will respawn the doll.
On the Four-Corners Farm:  Players may catch an Ancient Doll while fishing.
Note:  Killing this doll counts toward the Monster Eradication goal of killing 200 bats.




Telephone message 


If the player owns a Telephone, they may receive a mysterious telephone call



“

“You place the receiver to your ear, and are met with a roiling, abrasive static. But wait... beneath it all, you can make out something else... an otherworldly voice... 'Y-O-U H-A-V-E F-O-R-S-A-K-E-N U-S'”



History
