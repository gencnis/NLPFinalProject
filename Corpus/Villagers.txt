Villagers are characters in Stardew Valley. They are citizens who live in and around Pelican Town. Each villager has a daily routine, so they can be located in different sections of town depending on the in-game time of the day.
Villagers provide quests and can be given gifts to increase affection. Each villager has unique likes and dislikes, and will respond to gifts differently.
