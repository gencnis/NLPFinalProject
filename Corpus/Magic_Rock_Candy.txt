Tailoring
Magic Rock Candy is used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the prismatic Magic Sprinkle Shirt.  

Quests
Magic Rock Candy is not used in any quests.

Notes
Though it cannot be cooked, its underlying category in the game's data files is "Cooking", so Magic Rock Candy shows up on the "Cooked Items" tab of the Gift Log on the Social tab in-game after giving it as a gift.
Because it is a "cooked" item, it cannot be added to the Luau soup.
History
1.4: Introduced.
1.4.1: The Desert Trader now only sells one Magic Rock Candy each Thursday.
