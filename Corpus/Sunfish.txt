The Sunfish is a fish that can be caught in the river (in Pelican Town or Cindersap Forest) during Spring and Summer during sunny weather. It may also be caught on the Riverlands Farm, Forest Farm, or Hill-top Farm. It may also randomly be found at the Traveling Cart for 100-1,000g or in Garbage Cans during Spring and Summer.
Sunfish can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait.

Tailoring
Sunfish can be used in the spool of the Sewing Machine to create the dyeable Fish Shirt.   It can be used in dyeing, serving as an orange dye at the dye pots, located in Emily's and Haley's house, 2 Willow Lane.

Fish Pond
Sunfish can be placed in a Fish Pond, where they will reproduce every day. The initial pond capacity is 3 fish, but the capacity can be increased to 10 by completing two quests. The primary output is orange Sunfish Roe, but Solar Essence is also possible at population 10.
