1 Willow Lane


Occupants:

 Jodi Kent Sam Vincent


1 Willow Lane is the address of Jodi, Kent, Sam and Vincent. It's the house just next to Pelican Town's southwest passage.  The house just next door belongs to Haley and Emily.
Initially Kent is away, and the only occupants are Jodi, Sam and Vincent. He returns at the start of the second year.

Interior Layout
Just inside the house to the right is Vincent's bedroom.  The larger bedroom beside that belongs to Sam. Jodi and Kent share a bedroom in the back of the house, past the kitchen. They have a single bed, despite other married couples having a double bed.
Players must gain two hearts of friendship with each character before being allowed access to their bedroom.


Secret
If a Strange Bun is placed inside of the toy box in Vincent's bedroom, the player will receive a  ??Foroguemon?? statue.
