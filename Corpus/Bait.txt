This article is about the item category. For the item, see Bait (item).
Bait can be attached to a Fiberglass Rod or an Iridium Rod, or inserted into a Crab Pot. Fishing rods do not require bait, but fish will bite faster with bait; specialized baits provide additional benefits. Crab Pots require bait to catch fish (unless the player has the Luremaster profession), but there is no difference when using specialized types of bait. Bait is always a single-use item.

Use
To attach bait to a fishing rod, open the inventory, click on the bait ( left-click or  right-click, depending on how many bait will be used), and then  on the rod.  To remove bait,  on the rod.  
Each cast uses one piece of bait or one magnet.  When all bait is used up, the game pops up a notification saying "You've used your last piece of bait."
On an Xbox controller, press  on the bait to select the whole stack (or  to pick up a single one), then  to attach to the rod.
On a PS4 controller, press  on the bait to select the whole stack (or  to pick up a single one), then  to attach to the rod.
On a Nintendo Switch Controller, Press  on the bait to select the whole stack (Or  to pick up a single one), then  to attach to the rod.
Bait can be detached by pressing  on either Controller. ( on Nintendo Switch)
For the mobile version, bait can be added to the fishing rod by opening the inventory, then dragging the bait and dropping it on top of the rod.
