“

“Animals are so innocent, so sweet. And If I don't look after them, who will? I just hope my chickens aren't too upset when I take their eggs.”


— Marnie


Marnie is a villager who lives at Marnie's Ranch in the northeast area of Cindersap Forest, near the southwest entrance to Pelican Town.
Marnie runs her own shop at Marnie's Ranch from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM each day, except Monday and Tuesday, although the building is still open on these days. She sells animals and animal supplies.

Schedule
After the Beach Resort on Ginger Island is unlocked, Marnie may randomly spend Monday and/or Tuesday there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Marnie will immediately go home to bed. Marnie never visits the Resort on Festival days or her checkup day at Harvey's Clinic.

Marnie lives with her niece, Jas, and her nephew, Shane.  When it is not raining, she exercises with Caroline, Jodi, Emily, and Robin on Tuesdays at Pierre's General Store.
Mayor Lewis and Marnie have a very close relationship. Although Marnie claims to be single during the Flower Dance, Lewis and Marnie's 6-heart event confirms that they are dating.  Lewis visits Marnie's Ranch to attend to her "business needs" on occasion, and the two can often be found drinking together at the Stardrop Saloon in the evening.  In one of the story quests, Lewis asks you to find his lucky purple shorts, which can be found in Marnie's bedroom.

Three Hearts I

Leave your farmhouse between 6:30am - 9:30am.



Details 


Marnie greets the player as they come out of the farmhouse. She will tell the player that she is trying to train her goats to say "hello" but they will not cooperate unless she has their favorite food, Cave Carrots. Marnie asks the player to bring one to her ranch between 9 AM and 5 PM. If the player enters Marnie's Ranch during that time (opening hours may contradict this) with a Cave Carrot in their inventory, a cutscene will occur with the player giving Marnie the carrot. This cutscene will trigger regardless of whether or not Marnie is home.

Three Hearts II

After reaching 3 hearts, Marnie sends you a recipe in the mail.

Lewis says it would undermine his authority, while Marnie says he's too concerned for his job.  In the end, Marnie says she'll keep their relationship a secret.  Afterwards, you'll pop up and scare both Lewis and Marnie.  Lewis asks you if you heard anything, and you are presented with a choice.
