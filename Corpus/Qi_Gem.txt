Qi Gem





A special currency honored by Mr. Qi.


Information 


Source:

 Mr. Qi (Quests)Monsters in dangerous Mines or Skull Cavern


Sell Price:

Cannot be sold


Qi Gems are obtained by completing challenges in Mr. Qi's walnut room on Ginger Island, and used to buy rewards in the same room. They can also be received from selling Golden Walnuts and can be dropped from monsters in the "dangerous" version of The Mines and during the Skull Cavern Invasion quest. Stick Bugs in the Dangerous Mines are guaranteed to drop a Qi Gem when slain, with a 50% chance of dropping an extra one. The amount of Qi Gems that a player has is displayed directly above the wallet in the skills tab.

Tips
Two easy ways to convert Qi gems into gold are:

Buying hoppers and deconstructing them using Deconstructors into radioactive bars which sell for 3,000g each. This method is more profitable, but takes more time and requires deconstructors. Using this method each Qi gem is worth 300g.
Buying Galaxy Souls which sell for 5,000g each. Using this method each Qi gem is worth 125g.
