Achievements are displayed on the player menu, under the "Collections" tab, on the "Achievements" tab found at the bottom left. If playing the game on Steam, achievements are displayed in Steam as well. There are also some extra achievements specific to Steam.
Achievements can unlock specific rewards within the game.  Steam achievements need to be unlocked only once, but the associated rewards must be earned separately for each new game.
Unearned achievements appear as grayed-out on the player menu.  Some achievements do not display on the player menu until completing other achievements.
Most achievements unlock a unique hat for sale at the abandoned house in Cindersap Forest.  In addition, the day after earning "Gofer" (Complete 10 Help Wanted requests), Mayor Lewis will send 500g in the mail.  The day after earning "A Big Help" (Complete 40 Help Wanted requests), Mayor Lewis will send 2,500g in the mail.  The day after earning "Master Angler" (Catch every fish), Willy will send a Stardrop in the mail.

Users with access to their saved game files may find the "Stardew Checkup" utility helpful for tracking their achievement progress.  The utility is located at:  https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-checkup/
Note that there is a bug preventing the checkup utility from working after the Group Ten Heart Event if the negative outcome has occurred. The issue is resolved when the marriage candidates forgive the player.
