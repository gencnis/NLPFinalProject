Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

For an index to the completed cooking collection, see Collections#Cooking.
Cooking is a game mechanic that becomes available after upgrading the farmhouse for the first time. The house upgrade adds a kitchen, which includes a stove and a refrigerator. The stove is the cooking interface, while the refrigerator provides 36 slots of storage space, similar to a chest. The refrigerator is unique in that it is directly linked with the cooking interface, as if it were an extension of the player's inventory. Only ingredients in the player's inventory, refrigerator or Mini-Fridge are seen as usable items for a recipe.
Alternatively, after reaching Foraging level 9 the player can use a Cookout Kit to cook anywhere.
The player must learn each recipe before it is unlocked for cooking. Locked recipes are displayed as a black silhouette of the recipe icon, with a tooltip description that says "???." Unlocked recipe icons will appear greyed-out if any of the ingredients are missing, but the tooltip will provide information regarding the recipe. Any missing ingredients will be highlighted in red. If all the ingredients required for a recipe are present either in the player's inventory or the refrigerator (or a combination of the two) the recipe icon will become fully highlighted.

Buffs
Only one food’s buffs can be active at a time, so eating a food with buffs will wipe out any active food buffs and replace them with the buffs from the newly eaten food. If a newly eaten food has no buffs, any existing buffs will remain in effect. Drink buffs are handled separately, so buffs from one drink (Triple Shot Espresso, Coffee, Green Tea or Ginger Ale) can be stacked with one food’s buffs.
Buff duration varies for each food and drink (see table below)[1], but is the same for all buff effects of a given food or drink, except Squid Ink Ravioli. Using Qi Seasoning increases the duration by 50%.

Achievements
There are three Achievements associated with Cooking:

Cook (Cook 10 different recipes)
Sous Chef (Cook 25 different recipes)
Gourmet Chef (Cook every recipe)
Qi Seasoning
Qi Seasoning, which can be purchased from Qi's Walnut Room for  10 for a stack of ten, makes cooked food Gold quality, increasing its health and energy values by 80% and its sell price by 50%. It will also increase the buffs given (excluding Speed buffs) by one level. For example, Seafoam Pudding would give +5 fishing rather than +4 if cooked with Qi Seasoning. It will be used automatically if it is in inventory, the refrigerator, or a Mini-Fridge when cooking. Running out of Qi Seasoning will result in a message saying: "You've used up all of your Qi Seasoning."

Ingredients
A minimum of 87 different types of items are needed to cook all 80 dishes in the game, including:

26 crop products
13 foraged goods
4 tree fruits
2 animal products
4 artisan goods
2 miscellaneous items (maple syrup, squid ink)
17 items obtained from fishing
8 crab pot items
5 items bought from Pierre's General Store
6 dishes used as ingredients
These tables assume crafted dishes will be used to make other crafted dishes.  For example, 1 Potato would be used to make Hashbrowns, then those Hashbrowns would be used to make Complete Breakfast.  1 more Potato would be needed to make Hashbrowns for Dish O' The Sea.  When finished, the Gourmet Chef achievement would be earned for cooking every dish, but there would be no Hashbrowns because they were used to make the other dishes.

Profitable Recipes
See Also: When to turn fish into sashimi
While most recipes will sell for less than the cost or profit from their ingredients, there are a few that will always result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients.  
Note: It may be more profitable to save Fish for "Help Wanted" quests, which generally pay triple the fish's base value, than to turn them into Sashimi.
The following recipes will result in profit when using the lowest-quality ingredients:




 Algae Soup
 Bean Hotpot
 Blackberry Cobbler (either without Bear's Knowledge or using Wheat Flour and/or Sugar from the Mill)
 Bread (if made with Wheat Flour from the Mill)
 Carp Surprise (though Sashimi is more profitable)
 Chocolate Cake (if using Wheat Flour and Sugar from the Mill)
 Eggplant Parmesan
 Fiddlehead Risotto (if made with homemade Oil)
 Fruit Salad
 Lucky Lunch
 Maki Roll (if using Rice from the Mill and fish worth less than 100g)
 Pale Broth
 Pink Cake (if using Wheat Flour and Sugar from the Mill)
 Poppyseed Muffin (if using Wheat Flour and Sugar from the Mill)
 Red Plate
 Rhubarb Pie (if using Wheat Flour and Sugar from the Mill)
 Roots Platter
 Spaghetti (if made with Wheat Flour from the Mill)
 Spicy Eel
 Stir Fry (if made with homemade Oil)
 Survival Burger (if using Bread made with Wheat Flour from the Mill)
 Tom Kha Soup
 Tropical Curry
 Trout Soup


 Sashimi, when cooked with any fish worth less than 75g:
 Anchovy
 Bream
 Carp
 Chub★
 Cockle★
 Ghostfish
 Herring
 Mussel
 Oyster
 Perch★
 Periwinkle
 Rainbow Trout☆
 Red Snapper★
 Sardine
 Shad☆
 Shrimp☆
 Smallmouth Bass★
 Snail☆
 Sunfish
☆Not profitable with the Fisher or Angler professions
★Not profitable with the Angler Profession


However, for maximum profit, it is always better to process ingredients in a Preserves Jar, Keg, Mayonnaise Machine, or Cheese Press.
The only noteworthy exceptions (since cooking is the only way to process algae, cave carrots, winter root, and fish) are Algae Soup (+40g), Pale Broth (+100g), Roots Platter with regular quality winter root (+5g), and Sashimi with low-tier fish. Aside from these four recipes, cooking for profit only becomes attractive if the ingredient production greatly exceeds the processing capacity.

Quests
100,000g worth of freshly cooked items are requested in the Qi's Cuisine quest. During this quest, cooking will create dishes with the word "Fresh" at the beginning of their names (i.e., Fresh Fried Egg, Fresh Omelet, etc.), which cannot stack with food items cooked before the start of the quest.

Notes
Every recipe searches for ingredients in the following locations, always in the same order from the bottom right slot to the top left slot:
first in the player's inventory
then in the main refrigerator
finally in any Mini-Fridges
When auto-sorted with the Organize button, this bottom-right-first order will automatically consume lower quality items of the same type. However, for recipes with substitutes, place ingredients accordingly as desired towards the bottom right, in order to avoid using more valuable ingredients in less valuable recipes, or in recipes that accept a wide variety of ingredients. As an example, Tuna (which is required for Fish Taco) is accepted in Sashimi which accepts any type of fish. However, by placing a Mussel in the bottom right slot, the Mussel will be picked first and save the Tuna for the more exclusive and valuable recipe.
When searching multiple Mini-Fridges, the game picks from the last placed one in the exact chronological order in which the fridges were first placed, and then works backwards. The location of the fridge in the farmhouse does not matter.


Bugs
Mobile only: Eating a food that gives a buff and then pressing the ‘Swap to previous save’  button will carry the buffs to the previous save.  This can be used to eat difficult to craft/find food without losing it.
The game has a limited display area for active buffs at the top right of the screen (about the width of 3½ buff icons). For any buff icons active outside of that range, the source and timer will not be displayed when hovered over.
References

↑ Buff duration for each food and drink appears in Content\Data\ObjectInformation.xnb at the 8th index. The given number must be then multiplied by 700 to have the duration in milliseconds. The formula in set in Buff::Buff in the game code.


History
Sometime between v1.11 and v1.3, a bug was removed that caused the duration of buffs to decrease as the day progressed.
1.3.27: Artichoke Dip, Pumpkin Pie, Chowder, and Lobster Bisque now accept Large Milk in place of regular milk.
1.4: Added Shrimp Cocktail, Seafoam Pudding, Triple Shot Espresso.  Fixed bugged Bean Hotpot buff.  Standardized cooking tab with stove interface across all languages.  Added Mini-Fridge as a storage option for ingredients.
1.5: Added Banana Pudding, Ginger Ale, Mango Sticky Rice, Poi, Tropical Curry, Squid Ink Ravioli.  Goat Milk and Large Goat Milk can now be used in recipes.
