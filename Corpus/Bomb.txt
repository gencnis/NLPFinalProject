The Bomb is a one-time use explosive item.  It damages certain items within its radius.  Other items are impervious to its effects.
Bombs can be crafted or purchased from the Dwarf (both in the Volcano Dungeon and The Mines) for 600g.  They're also offered by the Desert Trader who will exchange five Quartz for one bomb. Bats, Lava Crabs, Squid Kids, and Serpents can also drop bombs when slain.  Ten Bombs may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern. 3-5 Bombs may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm provided the player has upgraded the Farmhouse exactly once.

Effects
Note that the following is not an exhaustive list:

Rocks and ore/gem nodes will drop their respective ores, gems, etc.
Mushrooms and foraged minerals will be destroyed.
Any untilled dirt tiles or Artifact Spots within a significantly smaller radius will become tilled, dropping any items (e.g., clay, artifacts) at the same rate as a player using a hoe.
Crafted artisan and refining equipment will be destroyed.
Heaters will be destroyed.
Auto-Grabbers will not be destroyed, whether empty or containing items.
Trees will be destroyed when their health reaches zero (this may require more than one bomb).  Trees will drop wood, sap, and any seeds they contained.
Radius
The Bomb has a radius of 5 (diameter of 11).
