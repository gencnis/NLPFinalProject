It is also cooked by Gus during the Stardew Valley Fair and can be eaten for free. 1-2 Survival Burger may occasionally be found in Supply Crates on the Beach Farm if the player has not upgraded the Farmhouse yet.
Survival Burger may randomly appear in Krobus' shop on Saturdays.  5 Survival Burgers may occasionally be found in a treasure room in the Skull Cavern.
Note: this recipe is profitable - it will always result in profit when using the lowest quality ingredients as well as Bread made from Wheat Flour made in the Mill.
