Address:

The Desert


Occupants:

 Mr. Qi


The Casino is located in the Calico Desert accessed through the back door of the Oasis. Access is initially blocked by the Bouncer until "The Mysterious Qi" quest is completed.
Mr. Qi is constantly present in the room. To his right is a machine to exchange gold for Qi coins, at a rate of 1,000g per 100, or 10g:1q value. Qi coins are used for both gambling and purchasing items inside the Casino, and aren't able to be converted back to gold.
To the top-left of the room is a terminal that lists multiple statistics for the player.
There are two forms of gambling available, slot machines and a variant of BlackJack, CalicoJack. There are two tables for CalicoJack, low stakes (100) to the left and high stakes (1,000) to the right.
In the upper right corner of the room, to the right of the machine for exchanging Qi coins and next to a potted plant, stands a shady individual who offers to sell Statue of Endless Fortune for 1,000,000g.

Store
The store is located in the top right of the casino. 
In some resolution settings, you may be unable to access the store without using the 'use button' or zooming out (go to menu, options). See this Steam forum post for resolution path details.

Tips



Warning: Spoilers
This page or section contains unmarked spoilers from update 1.5 of Stardew Valley.  Mobile players may want to avoid or be cautious toward reading this article.

Purchasing Warp Totems, deconstructing them and selling the resulting Honey is the most profitable way to convert Qi coins to gold, with a ratio of 10 to 2g (2.8g with the Artisan profession).
If the player takes the extra time to turn the Honey into Mead, then the ratio is doubled to become 10 to 4g (5.6g with the Artisan profession).
If the player does not have a Deconstructor, purchasing Hardwood Fences and selling them is the most profitable way to convert Qi coins to gold, with a ratio of 10 to 1g.
History
1.3.27: Fixed bug where crafting stats would be 0 if the player had not crafted an item the day of visiting the Casino.
1.4: Casino minigames now slightly favor the player.  Random number generation fixed to prevent repeating patterns in Slot Machines.
1.5: Store now stocks Modern Double Bed.
