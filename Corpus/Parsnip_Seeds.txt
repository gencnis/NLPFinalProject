Parsnip Seeds are a type of seed. Mature plants yield Parsnips.
Fifteen seeds are provided by Mayor Lewis at the start of the game.  Thereafter, they can be purchased at Pierre's General Store, at JojaMart, from the Magic Shop Boat at the Night Market on Winter 15, and occasionally from the Traveling Cart.  They can also be obtained by using the Seed Maker, as well as having a chance of being planted when using Mixed Seeds. Five to twenty Parsnip Seeds may occasionally be found in treasure rooms in the Skull Cavern.
