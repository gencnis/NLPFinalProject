The Catfish is a fish that can be caught in the river (in Pelican Town or Cindersap Forest), the Secret Woods, the Witch's Swamp, and the Riverlands Farm, Forest Farm, or Hill-Top Farm during Spring and Fall when raining, or in Spring, Summer, and Fall during rain in the Secret Woods or Witch's Swamp. It can also be caught in Winter at these locations if a Rain Totem is used. It can be randomly be found in Garbage Cans during Spring and Fall, or at the Traveling Cart for 600-1,000g.
Catfish can be caught regardless of weather, time, or season using Magic Bait.

Quests
Item Delivery: One catfish may be randomly requested in Spring or Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 600g and 150 Friendship points.
Fishing: Demetrius or Willy may randomly request 1-4 catfish in Spring or Fall at the "Help Wanted" board outside Pierre's General Store for a reward of 200g per fish.  (You get to keep the fish).
History
1.4: Removed from garbage cans and most quests in Winter.  Added iridium quality.  Can now be used in Tailoring.
1.4.4: Fixed a mistake in the game data that prevented catfish-specific fish pond data from being applied (in earlier versions, catfish used the same fish pond data as all generic river fish). Catfish can no longer be requested by Willy in a Fishing Help Wanted quest during Winter.
