The Tea Sapling is a seed that takes 20 days to grow into a Tea Bush. A Tea Bush produces one Tea Leaves item each day of the final week (days 22-28) of spring, summer, and fall (and winter if indoors).
Tea Saplings are planted like Trees by placing them onto untilled soil or into Garden Pots. They do not need to be watered in order to grow. Tea Saplings will not die and will even grow if planted outside in winter.
A Tea Sapling can be purchased from the Traveling Cart, though not often. Otherwise, it must be crafted. The crafting recipe is received via mail the day after Caroline's 2-Heart event.

Notes
Crafting and selling a Tea Sapling is more profitable than selling its ingredients.  The exact profit depends on the source of the Wild Seeds but is typically between 300g and  400g.
Tea Saplings can also be used as a substitute for fences, as the saplings are impassable and never wear out.
