Cloth is an Artisan Good made from the Loom using Wool, taking 4 hours.  It can also be made by recycling a Soggy Newspaper using the Recycling Machine, or dropped from Mummies when slain.  Emily may occasionally send you a Cloth in the mail. The Desert Trader will trade three Aquamarines for one cloth on Wednesdays.
Placing quality Wool into a Loom gives a chance to produce 2 Cloth.  Silver gives a 10% chance, gold gives a 25% chance, and iridium gives a 50% chance.
